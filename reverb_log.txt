reverb: Multi-channel reverberator
	Version 1.1 Release 4 CDP 1998,1999
usage: reverb [flags] infile outfile rgain mix rvbtime absorb
                                 lpfreq trailertime [times.txt]
flags    : any or all of the following:
   -cN   : create outfile with N channels (1 <= N <= 16 : default =  2)
   -eFILE: read early reflections from breakpoint textfile FILE
   -f    : force floating-point output (default: infile format)
   -HN   : apply Highcut filter with cutoff freq N Hz to infile (6db/oct)
   -LN   : apply Lowcut filter with cutoff freq N Hz to infile	(12dB/oct)
   -pN   : force reverb predelay to N msecs (shifts early reflections)
rgain    : set level of dense reverb (0.0 <= rgain <= 1.0)
mix      : dry/wet balance (source and reverb): 1.0<-- mix -->= 0.0
rvbtime  : reverb decay time (to -60dB) in seconds
absorb   : degree of hf damping to suggest air absorption: 0.0 <= absorb <= 1.0
lpfreq   : lowpass filter cutoff freq (Hz) applied at input to reverb
           to disable either filter (absorb, lpfreq), use the value 0
trtime   : trailer time added to outfile for reverb tail (secs)
times.txt: list of delay times (msecs) for 6 comb and 4 allpass filters
