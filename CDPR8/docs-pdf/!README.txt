CDP DOCS-PDF
============

• INTRODUCTORY
The Introductory pdfs reproduced here are also accessible from the Home Page and mirror those on the top level of \docs

• REFERENCE DOCUMENTATION
This collection contains the core CDP Reference Documentation in A4-printable PDF format.
It includes documents which were already published as PDFs in the CDP documentation. 

CDP functions are typically grouped together under a single program (e.b. moodify.exe). These Function Groups are often supplemented by extra standalone functions which have been assigned to the group for reference purposes only. Each Function Group has its own PDF file (e.g. modify.pdf). There are no active links within the PDFs.

• LISTS
There are also some indexes:
 - CDP Spiral Desk Reference (3 pdfs - up to Release 7)
 - CDP Groups: briefly describes each Function Group.
 - CDP Group Lists: all CDP functions, organised into CDP Groups
 - A-Z Index lists all CDP processes/functions in alphabetical order.

• CHARTS & TUTORIALS
Charts have also been included; these mirror the collection in charts-pdf.
Follow the links online at https://www.composersdesktop.com/docs/html/charts.htm 

Some tutorials have been included and others may be converted to PDF in the future.


Some revisions can be expected in due course, as the documentation is gradually updated.
Please report any anomalies that you find.
