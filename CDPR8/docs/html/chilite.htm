<h3>
Understanding the HILITE ARPEG Process
</h3>


<blockquote>
<p>
HILITE ARPEG means 'spectrum arpeggio' and causes a waveform at a specified 
frequency to sweep through the spectrum of a sound, selecting or emphasizing 
the partials it passes through (or which lie below it or above it), thus 
creating an 'arpeggiation' of the spectrum within the sound.
</p>

<p>
Note the interaction of the <b>-N</b> and <b>-s</b> parameters.  The one 
is controlling the envelope of the decay, and the other is sustaining across 
windows.  When a slow decay envelope (e.g., 0.2) is combined with a large 
number of windows across which to sustain data (e.g., &gt; 100), amplitude 
overflow can occur, sometimes massive amplitude overflow if the source is 
loud.  If PVOC comments on amplitude, take care to to read what it says 
before playing the sound.  Values for <b>-a</b> also affect amplitude 
output, so when near the limit with other factors, a lower value 
for <b>-a</b> can be helpful.
</p>

<p>
High values for <b>-N</b> can muffle the sound, and very high values can 
reduce it to silence.  You are recommended not to exceed a value of 7.
</p>

<p>
<b>Rule of Thumb:</b> increase the decay rate (higher value for <b>-N</b>) 
as you increase the sustain windows (<b>-s</b>).
</p>

<p>
The <b>-T</b> parameter causes arpeggios to follow (the moving) pitch 
content of the sound.  The <b>-K</b> parameter places the attacks in relief by 
making sure that the sustains run to zero before a new attack begins.
</p>

<p>
The appropriate <i>rate</i> parameter value can be imagined by likening 
the effect to a vibrato, i.e., a low frequency oscillator.  Something about 10 
to 20 cycles per second is what is expected, but slower than this can be 
used to create glissandos within the spectrum.  A single sweep through the 
sound can be useful, such as to create a sense of upwards transposition.  CDP 
user Peter Karkut came up with this idea as a way of preparing a sound for 
a morph.
</p>

<p>
The <i>rate</i> parameter, we are told, must be less than the analysis 
rate.  Note that this is NOT the value given for <b>-N</b> (now <b>-c</b>
<i>points</i> when analyzing sound, but rather the analysis frame rate.  
As explained in the <i>Phase Vocoder</i> Manual, this is 
(SR&#47;2)&#47;(N&#47;2), where SR is the sample rate and N is the value 
given for <b>-N</b>.  The result of this calculation is then multiplied by 
8, the number of window overlaps automatically made by the Phase Vocoder 
in order to improve the quality of the output.  A typical frame rate is 
344:  (44100&#47;2)&#47;(1024&#47;2) = 43.06;43.06 * 8 = 344.  So in this 
case, <i>rate</i> must be &lt; 344.  In practice, a value of 100 is about 
the limit, but the software does not prevent exploring what happens beyond 
this point.
</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>
Musical Applications
</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>
HILITE ARPEG can be used to create an unusual attack for a sound object.  
Because the wave sweeps through all the analysis channels, it serves to 
bring out internal features inside the sound.  Sometimes a pitch focus or 
harmonic colouration within the sound will result, particularly if the 
frequencies are being tracked (<b>-T</b>).
</p>

<p>
This process seems to work most clearly with sounds possessing strong 
and slowly moving partials, such as bell sounds and sounds perceived 
mostly as pitch (harmonic partials predominate over inharmonic partials).
</p>

<p>
Perception of the effect is also affected by the speed of the movement;  
it is more noticeable at slower speeds.  This can be timed to give a single 
sweep over the duration of the sound because the <i>rate</i> can be a 
floating point value (&gt; 0 but &lt; the analysis rate).  It might be 
interesting to try it on the result of a <a href="cspecedi.htm#BARE">
<b>SPEC BARE</b></a> process, because then the sweeping arpeggio will be 
emphasising the natural harmonic overtone series.
</p>

<p>
High sharp sweeps can be achieved with Mode 6, e.g., by a high value for 
<b>-h</b> and none for <b>-l</b>:  makes the sweeps occur above the 
<b>-h</b> frequency.  Try pushing this higher still, and playing with 
rates &lt; 1.
</p>

<p>
There are many factors to play off against one another in HILITE ARPEG, 
so creating a series of batch files with which to explore the function 
would be time well spent.  There are many serendipitous sounds hidden 
among the more obvious possibilities.  It is more of the most powerful 
functions in the spectral set. (Ed.)

<b>hilite band</b> <i>infile outfile datafile</i>
<br>

<h3>
Parameters
</h3>

<blockquote>
<i>infile</i> &#150; input analysis file made with PVOC<br>
<i>outfile</i> &#150; output analysis file<br>

written as (a number of) lines in the following format:<br>
	<p>
	<blockquote>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><i>lofrq hifrq bitflag</i> 
	[<i>amp1 amp2</i> [+]<i>transpose</i>]</b><br>
	</p>

	<p>
	<i>lofrq</i> and </i>hifrq</i> are entered in Hz and define the bottom 
	and top frequencies of a band within the spectrum of the sound<br>
	</p>

	<p>
	<i>bitflag</i> has 4 bits (e.g., '0101' or '1000'):
	</p>

	<p>
	<b>bit 1 set:</b> amplitude <b>change</b> to band: put amplitude 
	multiplier <i>amp1</i> in the line<br>
	<b>bit 2 set:</b> amplitude <b>ramp</b>: put 2<sup>nd</sup> amplitude 
	multiplier <i>amp2</i> in the line.  The spectral band will change 
	in amplitude from <i>amp1</i> to <i>amp2</i>.  This is a spectral 
	filter slope (envelope) between the stated frequency boundaries, 
	applied to the whole length of the sound.  Note that bit 1 also has 
	to be set:  e.g., 1100 for this function to work.<br>
	<b>bit 3 set:</b> partials <b>transpose</b>: the function expects the 
	frequency multiplier <i>transpose</i> to be in the line.  OR, if 
	the value is preceded by a '+', the value is ADDED to the

	<p>
	<i>amp1</i>, <i>amp2</i> &amp;&#47;or <i>transpose</i> MUST be

	</p>

	<p>
	<i>amp1</i> and <i>amp2</i> are amplitude multipliers, used as 
	described above<br>
	</p>

	<p>
	<i>transpose</i> is a frequency multiplier<br>

	</p>

<h3>
Understanding the HILITE BAND Process
</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>
HILITE BAND used to be called SPECSPLIT, which means 'spectrum split':   
divide the spectrum into a number of (user-defined) frequency bands.  
It then carries out amplitude and&#47;or pitch changes to the partials found 
in the bands.  Each band may be treated differently.  Typical use of HILITE 
BAND involves defining several data lines in order to create an arbitrary 
spectral filter envelope.  Each data line is a single line contributing to 
a sort of frequency response breakpoint shape.
</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>
Musical Applications
</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>
When you set a frequency band to zero, it is filtered out (bit 1 set 
to 0).  By retaining/emphasizing some frequency bands and zeroing 
others, you can focus on and enhance the bands you want to keep.  This 
is also a way to tune or harmonize sound material.  The data file for 
HILITE BAND can contain several lines, so several bands can be, and 
usually are, defined at one time.
</p>

<p>
Filter slope can be applied within frequency bands (bit 2 
set and values given for <i>amp1</i> and <i>amp2</i>).  In 
the line <code>3500 6000 1100 0.001 1.0</code>, the slope 
moves from 3500 Hz <b>upwards</b> towards 6000 Hz, and in the line 
<code>2000 3000 1100 1.0 0.001</code>, the slope moves <b>downwards</b> 
from 2000 Hz to 3000 Hz.  The two lines as a pair give this shape:<br />
<br />
<code>2000 3000 1100 1.0 &nbsp;&nbsp;0.001</code><br />
<code>3500 6000 1100 0.001 1.0</code><br />
<IMG SRC="images/hilitebandpair.gif"></a>
</p>

<p>
Note the potential of the transposition functions (bit 3 and bit 4). 
Transposition by multiplication means that the harmonic relationships 
are maintained (logarithmic).  Transposition by addition creates 
inharmonic relationships (linear).  The superimposition of frequency 
bands made possible by bit 4 will have the effect of thickening the 
resultant sound in some way &#150; which probably won't be very predictable.

<h3>
Parameters
</h3>

<blockquote>

	<p>
	<blockquote>
	<i>blurring</i> AND <i>tracing</i> may vary over time<br>
	</blockquote>
	</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>
Understanding the HILITE BLTR Process
</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>
In each window, all but the loudest (tracing) channels are discarded 
(see <a href="#TRACE"><b>HILITE TRACE</b></a>.  Then a proportion of the 
windows are discarded and replaced by values interpolated between the 
remaining windows (see <a href="gblur.htm#BLUR"><b>BLUR BLUR</b></a>.  The 
degree of the change will depend on the amplitude differential between 
the loudest and not so loud channels:  the louder the latter are, the 
more their absence will be noticed.
</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>
Musical Applications
</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>
The dual functionality of HILITE BLTR enables the sound designer to 
reduce the data by removing all but the <i>tracing</i> loudest 
channels, and simultaneously to smooth&#47;blur the remaining data 
by averaging the frequency and amplitude values contained in each 
set of <i>blurring</i> windows.  This is a good way to get softly 
modulating sounds.  However, we have seen with HILITE TRACE that a 
remarkable number of windows can go before the recognisability of the 
sound is seriously affected, so there is plenty of scope to soften 
the edges of a sound before recognisability is lost.
</p>

<p>
A high <i>blur</i> factor combined with a low <i>trace</i> factor 
greatly reduces and smooths the sound:  reduces it to a gentle murmur.  
You might also consider using FOCUS ACCU to alter&#47;intensify the 
blurring effect.

</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>
Musical Applications
</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>
The key facilities here are the time-varying frequency settings and Q.  
One can move the frequency placement about as the sound progresses, as 
well as change the sharpness (pitch focus) of the filter.  Suppose, for 
example, you extracted a pitch trace and saved the data as a breakpoint 
file.  This file could be used as a time-varying <i>frq1</i> with a 
time-varying <i>Q</i>, so that the salient pitch content of the file 
can be made to fade in and out.  Similarly, upward and downward sweeps 
which begin with a broad and end with a sharp pitch focus or <i>v.vs.</i> 
(<i>Q</i>), affecting changes over time, emerging or disappearing 
pitches etc.

</p>

<h3>
Parameters
</h3>

<blockquote>
<i>inanalfile</i> &#150; input analysis file<br />
<i>outanalfile</i> &#150; output analysis file<br />
<i>grpdiv</i> &#150; the number of sets into which to divide the analysis-channels.  For example, when <i>grpdiv</i> = 4, the program will process the partitions and channels randomly among 4 sets with the total number of channels &divide; 4 per set.  <b>Note that <i>grpdiv</i> must be an exact divisor of the channel count.</b> (Range: 2 to channel-count)<br />
<i>setdur</i> &#150; the number of windows for which a set-of-channels persists before we switch to the next set-of-chans.  (Range: 1 to 1024)<br />
<b>-p</b><i>pitchshift</i> &#150; The maximum range in (possibly fractional) semitones of random plus or minus pitch shifting (i.e., upwards or downwards) of each channel set.  (Range: 0.0 to 12.0.  Default: 0.0)<br />
<b>-d</b><i>durrand</i> &#150; the randomisation of <i>setdur</i> between 1 and <i>setdur</i>. (Range:  0 to 1)<br />
<b>-v</b><i>divrand</i> &#150; randomise the number of channels in each set in a group.  (Range: 0 to 1.)<br>  In the normal case, each set-of-channels has an equal number of channels.  When <i>divrand</i> is &gt; 0, a group will have sets of different sizes.
</blockquote>

<h3>
Understanding the GLISTEN Process
</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>
All the channels of the analysis are partitioned into <i>N</i> mutually exclusive sets, with channels assigned at random to each set.  These sets form a complete group.  Then channels in the first set are played, for <i>setdur</i> windows, at which point the channels in the 2<sup><small>nd</small></sup> set are played for <i>setdur</i> windows and so on.
</p>

<p>
As this happens, we are progressing through the original file at its original rate, the process determining merely which channels are used &#150; the others being zeroed.  Once all <i>N</i> sets are exhausted, a new group is made by random partition, and so on.
</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>
Musical Applications
</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>
This process is meant to 'animate' a fixed or relatively static spectrum.  The channels of the spectrum are selected (in groups) at random and played back in sequence.

<h3>
Understanding the HILITE GREQ Process
</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>
This is in concept a standard graphic equaliser, with a choice between 
bands of equal size or bands of varyingly specified sizes.  A sonogram 
display may help to show how strong signal areas may be reduced (or enhanced 
by removing bands of frequencies which lie between them).  Also see the 
spectral information gathering functions listed below.

</blockquote>

<h3>
Musical Applications
</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>
The graphic equaliser is typically used to boost certain selected parts 
of a sound, and reduce others, such as high level hiss or low booming.  
This 'EQ type' filter does not have a gain parameter as such and focuses on 
highlighting (or removing) the selected bands.

<h2 id="PLUCK">HILITE PLUCK &#150; Emphasise spectral changes (use e.g., 
with HILITE ARPEG)</h2>


<h3>
Usage
</h3>
<b>hilite pluck</b> <i>infile outfile gain</i>
<br>

<h3>
Parameters
</h3>

<blockquote>
<i>infile</i> &#150; input analysis file made with PVOC<br>
<i>outfile</i> &#150; output analysis file<br>
<i>gain</i> &#150; amplitude gain applied to newly prominent spectral components 
(Range: 1 to 1000)
	<p>
	<blockquote>
	<i>gain</i> may vary over time
	</blockquote>
	</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>
Understanding the HILITE PLUCK Process
</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>
In analysis files generated from complex soundfiles by functions such as 
HILITE TRACE and HILITE ARPEG, new partials will enter (and leave) the 
spectrum, window by window, creating a kind of 'resultant melody'.  
HILITE PLUCK emphasises the entry of these new partials by boosting their 
amplitude at the point of entry.  If the amplitude boost is large, such as 
increased by a <i>gain</i> of 10 or more, the entries may suggest a 
'plucking' of the entering partials.
</p>

<p>
Note that the 'pluck' effect is added to the onset of partials.  This 
is quite different from emphasising the attack transient of a sound in 
the amplitude envelope.  See <a href="cgroenvl.htm#PLUCK"><b>ENVEL PLUCK</b></a> 
for this, where a noise component is introduced into the attack transient 
of a sound.
</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>
Musical Applications
</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>
This procedure will introduce into the sound a somewhat random rhythm 
of short pulses.  These pulses will attract the ear to the entering 
partials and whatever harmonic relationship they may have &shy; such as 
the harmonic partials retained after running SPEC BARE.  SPEC BARE + 
HILITE TRACE + HILITE PLUCK form an interesting combination of functions 
to play with, and HILITE PLUCK can also be used to bring out the partials 
which HILITE ARPEG makes more audible.

	<br>
	<p>
	<i>N</i>, <i>lofrq</i> and <i>hifrq</i> may vary over time
	</p>
	</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<h3>
Understanding the HILITE TRACE Process
</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>
HILITE TRACE looks for and retains only the <i>N</i> loudest partials 
in the analysis data on a window-by-window basis.  
This reduces the data in the spectral dimension and produces an 
aural 'trace'  of the original sound.
</p>
<p>
With  non-'noisy' sources it is necessary to reduce the number of channels 
quite considerably to make any appreciable aural change to the source 
sound.  Even the 10 loudest channels will retain a surprising amount 
of the original sound.  The flip-side of this is that HILITE TRACE can be 
used to 'clean' a sound, if a certain amount of data loss is not a 
problem (see below).
</p>

<p>
This procedure deals with analysis channels, not directly with partials.  
It will retain whichever partial is contained 
in a given analysis channel window at any given moment in time, and this 
is likely to change.  To find specific partials requires 'peak tracking', 
and this is not something which the CDP software is able to do.  Thus a 
sonogram of 1 channel retained by HILITE TRACE will probably show a number 
of different frequencies. The frequency width of an analysis channel is obtained by dividing the sample rate by the number of channels:  e.g., 
<code>44100 / 1024 = 43</code>.  This enables you to calculate the 
width of the frequency band that a given number of channels will cover.  Remember that partials are more spread out in higher sounds (frequency is logarithmic), so low sounds are likely to contain more partials within 
a smaller band, while the same width might find relatively few in a high 
sound. For an alternative approach, see <a href = 
"http://mpex.prosoniq.com">http://mpex.prosoniq.com</a>.[AE]
</p>

<p>
The HILITE TRACE filtering effect can be further controlled by using 
the <i>lofrq</i> and <i>hifrq</i> parameters.  The default is to <b>omit</b> 
the data outside the selected area, but if the <b>-r</b> flag is used, this 
data is <b>retained</b>.
</p>

<p>
For example, the frequency band can be focused into a narrower band by 
creating a breakpoint file for <i>hifrq</i> which starts high and moves 
lower, and creating a breakpoint file for <i>lofrq</i> which starts low 
and moves higher (but stays below the final frequency value in <i>hifrq</i>).
</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>
Musical Applications
</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>
Initially, this process can be used to clean up some of the ambient noise 
which is part of a sound source, if for example, only 50 or 100 channels 
are retained.  However, some spectral information may be lost as well, 
when cleanup is done in this way.
</p>

<p>
However, as one moves down to 50, 40, 30, 20, 10, 5 ..., less and less 
of the original remains, though it is surprising how low one has to go 
to get a really 'ghostly' result.  At this stage, the original is being 
used simply as a source for another sound.  Strongly and rapidly changing 
sounds can produce a burbling effect.

<i>Threshold</i> defines this proportion.  Default: 0.5<br />
</blockquote>

<h3>
Understanding the HILITE VOWELS Process
</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>
The <i>vowelfile</i> is a straightforward breakpoint file, with 
the <i>times</i> in the left column and the <i>vowels</i> as 
defined above in the right column:
<pre>
<font color="#FF0000">[times  vowels]</font>
 0.0    ai
 3.0    ee
 6.0    oa
 9.0    ar
12.0    i
</pre>
This process allows a sequence of vowels to be imposed over a 
spectrum derived from an input sound.  The spectrum itself must 
have enough energy over all frequency ranges for the vowel 
formants to 'bite'  e.g., a very pure pitch sound (a sine tone) 
only has energy at one place in the spectrum. The vowel formant 
has nothing much to shape, and the vowel sound will not be formed. 
Noisy sounds are best. If you want to impose vowel formants on 
strongly pitched sounds if may be  best to extract the pitch and 
then use REPITCH VOWELS OVER PITCHFILE. 
</p>

<p>
The process glides between vowels specified at different times 
in a breakpont file. e.g. if you set the vowel 'a' at time 0 and 
also at time '1', the output will generate an 'a' sound. But if 
the vowel at time 1 is set to 'i', the output will do a vowel-glide 
(diphthong) from 'a' to 'i'.  Speech characteristics can thus be 
imposed on pitch contours derived from pitched source. 
</p>

<p>
The sound onto which the vowels are imposed needs to a rich, noisy 
sound with fairly evenly spread energy.  Otherwise, the vowel contours 
may find that they have nothing in the original sound to with which 
to work.
</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>
Musical Applications
</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>
This process can be used to create time-varying spectra or even the 
illusion of speech.
