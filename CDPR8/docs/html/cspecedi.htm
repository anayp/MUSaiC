<h2>
<a name="ANALJOIN">ANALJOIN JOIN</a> &#150; Join analysis files together
</h2>

<h3>
Usage
</h3>
<b>analjoin join</b> <i>inanalfile1 inanalfile2</i> [<i>inanalfile3 ...</i>] 
<i>outanalfile</i><br />

<p>
Example command line to join analysis files:<br>
	<blockquote>
	<b><code>analjoin join file1.ana file2.ana file1join2.ana</code></b>
	</blockquote>
</p>

<h3>
Parameters
</h3>

<blockquote>
<i>inanalfile2</i> &#150; first input analysis file<br />
<i>inanalfile2</i> &#150; second input analysis file to join with first<br />
[<i>inanalfile3 ...</i>] &#150; third (or more) input analysis files to 
join<br />
<i>outanalfile</i> &#150; output analysis file with all inputs joined 
together:  spliced end-to-end in the order of input<br />
</blockquote>

<h3>
Understanding the ANALJOIN JOIN Function
</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>
ANALJOIN is a straightforward join utility.  Note that there is no 
splicing window function, which does not apply in the spectral analysis 
data domain. For technical reasons, it may not always be possible to achieve a smooth join.
</p>

</blockquote>

<h3>
Musical applications
</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>
This enables us to join files in the spectral domain without having to return to the time domain to do so. 
</p>

<p>
The process can be particularly useful when wanting to create analysis 
data with a great deal of variation in it, for example to create slow 
transitions by time-stretching such a file.
</p>

<!--
<p>
At the time of writing, the second and subsequent files have a flutter 
on them.  This is not intended and the reason for it is not yet known.  
Nevertheless a rather nice result.  Perhaps it could be retained as an 
option!

<h2 id="BARE">SPEC BARE &#150; Zero the data in channels which do not 
contain harmonics</h2>

<h3>
Usage 
</h3>
<b>spec bare</b> <i>infile pitchfile outfile</i> [<b>-x</b>]<br>

<h3>
Parameters
</h3>


<blockquote>
<i>infile</i> &#150; input analysis files made with PVOC<br>
<i>outfile</i> &#150; output analysis file<br>
	<i>pitchfile</i> &#150; a binary pitch data file 

	<blockquote>
	The <i>pitchfile</i> must be 
	extracted from your <i>infile</i> analysis file before 
	running SPEC BARE so it is ready to be used as an input.<br>
	This is done with <a href="crepitch.htm#GETPITCH"><b>REPITCH 
	GETPITCH</b></a>, normally using the <b>-z</b> flag to mark any 
	unpitched material<br>
	</blockquote>
	</p>
	<b>-x</b> more body in resulting spectrum<br>
</blockquote>

<h3>
Understanding the SPEC BARE Process
</h3> 
<blockquote>
<p>
SPEC BARE zeroes all the non-partial data, retaining the harmonics of the 
original tone.  The harmonics are the integer multiples of the fundamental.  
When the original is a complex sound, the actual result is dependent on what 
the GETPITCH process works out this fundamental to be.
</p>

<p>
If the original sound is a clearly pitched tone, it is probable that 
harmonic partials will be captured in some channels.  SPEC BARE will 
zero out the data in the channels which do not contain harmonic 
partials, to provide a good, clean version of the original for 
further processing.
</p>

<p>
If the original sound is a complex tone with many inharmonic partials, 
then the SPEC BARE process may not work.  The windows will be flagged as 
having no pitch.  However, I (Ed.) have used it on a donkey bray and 
found that the result somehow brought out an overtone series.  This 
was then further emphasised by applying HILITE PLUCK to the SPEC BARE 
output.
</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>
Musical Applications
</h3> 
<blockquote>
<p>
As implied above, the musical uses of SPEC BARE begin when another 
process needs to work with clearly identified partials content, such 
as emphasising pitch content, overtone series, or harmonic colouration.  
</p>

<i>noisgain</i> &#150;   multiplies noise levels found in <i>nfile</i> before they 
are used for comparison with <i>infile</i> signal: (Default 2)<br>
</blockquote>

<h3>
Understanding the SPEC CLEAN Process
</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>
There are now several ways to approach the removal of unwanted noise, including
<a href="cspecnu.htm#CLEAN"><b>SPECNU CLEAN</b></a> and other functions within SPECNU. 
</p>

<p>
SPEC CLEAN works by comparing the level (for each channel in turn) in 
<i>nfile</i> (the noise file) with the level in the sound to be cleaned.  
To find the noise threshold in any channel, i.e., the level below which 
we decide the data is merely noise and not significant signal, the 
program looks at the whole <i>nfile</i> and takes the maximum level it 
finds (in each channel) as the noise threshold (for each particular 
channel).
</p>
 
<p>
If <i>noisgain</i> is then set as e.g., 2, then the noise threshold 
(for each channel in turn) is set 2-times louder than the threshold 
extracted from the noise file.
</p>

<p>
In Mode <b>1</b>, as soon as the level in (the particular channel of) 
the file to be cleaned falls below the threshold (for that channel), 
the channel data is eliminated from that time to the end of the 
file.  This is therefore useful for cleaning up the end of a file 
where the sound source is perhaps fading away, and falls below the 
noise threshold.
</p>

<p>
In Mode <b>2</b>, the channel data is eliminated ANYWHERE it falls 
below the noise threshold (for that channel), but the data is restored 
at any time it rises above that threshold again.
</p>

<p>
Mode <b>3</b> works like Mode <b>2</b>, but only on a specified 
high frequency area.
</p>

<p>
Mode <b>4</b> attempts to look for channels which contribute 'nothing' 
to the spectrum of the sound required.  It does this by comparing a 
noise segment with a good signal segment, and deciding which channels 
are 'redundant', i.e., are always below the noise threshold.
</p>

<p>
The key to its use therefore lies in selecting effective sections of the 
soundfile for these reference levels.  Listen carefully to the source 
soundfile, noting where appropriate sections begin and end, and use these 
times to cut the input (analysis) file with SPEC CUT to produce the required 
comparison files.
</p>

<p>
This may take some trial and error.  Listen for 'bubbling' effects;  
these may occur if the noise level or the noise comparison sample 
isn't quite right to achieve the desired noise reduction.
</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>
Musical Applications
</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>
This process can be useful in tidying up the signal of e.g., an analogue 
recording.  However, the user is cautioned that the methods used here are 
relatively simple and are not sufficiently 'intelligent' to professionally 
digitally remaster analogue recordings.
</p>

<h2 id="CUT">SPEC CUT &#150; Cut a section out of an analysis file, 
between <i>starttime</i> and <i>endtime</i> (seconds)</h2>

<h3>
Usage
</h3>
<b>spec cut</b> <i>infile outfile starttime endtime</i>
<br>

<h3>
Parameters
</h3>

<blockquote>
<i>infile</i> &#150; input analysis file made with PVOC<br>
<i>outfile</i> &#150; output analysis file<br>
<i>starttime</i> &#150; time in seconds at which the cut is to begin<br>
<i>endtime</i> &#150; time in seconds at which the cut is to end<br>
</blockquote>

<h3>
Understanding the SPEC CUT Process
</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>
SPEC CUT makes it possible to extract a section of a PVOC analysis file and 
save it as a new analysis file.  The cut points are specified in seconds.  
</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>
Musical Applications
</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>
The primary application is simply to shorten an analysis file without 
having to go back to the original soundfile, cut that and re-analyze.  
Listening to the original soundfile should give a rough indication of 
where the cut points might best be located.
</p>

<p>
It is also used to select portions of an analysis file containing 
'typical noise' (the <i>nfile</i>) and 'good signal' (the <i>gfile</i>) 
for use with SPEC CLEAN.  To do this, one uses a standard sound editor, 
blocking out sections of the original source sound, listening to them, 
and making a note of the time points.  These time points are then used 
with SPEC CUT directly on the analysis file for that soundfile &#150; the 
times of source and analysis match.

<h2 id="GAIN">SPEC GAIN &#150; Amplify or attenuate the spectrum</h2>

<h3>
Usage
</h3>
<b>spec gain</b> <i>infile outfile gain</i>
<br>

<h3>
Parameters
</h3>

<blockquote>
<i>infile</i> &#150; input analysis file made with PVOC<br>
<i>outfile</i> &#150; output analysis file<br>
<i>gain</i> &#150; numerical float value &gt; 0.0
	<p>
	<blockquote>
	<i>gain</i> may vary over time<br>
	</blockquote>
	</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>
Understanding the SPEC GAIN Process
</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>
GAIN multiplies the amplitude of each partial with the <i>gain</i> factor.  
This will <b>attenuate</b> the amplitude if less than 1 and <b>increase</b> 
the amplitude if greater than 1.  For any soundfile, there is an optimal 
gain factor, above which distortion is created.<br>
</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>
Musical Applications
</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>
GAIN can be usefully applied to bring a sound up to full volume before 
running another process, or restoring it to full volume if it has 
lost amplitude as a result of the process.  However, it does need to 
be used with some caution.  Large or repeated amplifications of a poor 
signal will also amplify discontinuities and increase digital noise.<br>
</p>

<p>
Sometimes PVOC, the <i>Phase Vocoder</i>, recommends an increase or 
decrease in gain, esp. the latter, if an overflow has occurred.  SPEC 
GAIN is used to make this adjustment.
</p>

<p>
Excessive application of gain on a poor signal can introduce digital 
noise by creating sharp changes in amplitude levels.

<h3>
Understanding the SPEC GATE Process
</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>
SPEC GATE very simply cuts out low level signal. 
</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>
Musical Applications
</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>
It is intended as a facility by which various unwanted artefacts in 
the sound can be removed from the analysis file.  The use of the 
phase vocoder with various types of input sound can be somewhat 
unpredictable, with the result that 'artefacts' may be produced, 
often heard as a light swishing sound.

<h3>
Understanding the SPEC MAGNIFY Process

<p>
This function was previously named SPECWEXP.  It synthesizes a steady sound

Listen for material in the source which might benefit from being drawn out 
for a longer period of time.  A wide range of frequencies and rapidly 
changing timbral content are two things to listen for.
</p>

<p>
Note that the resynthesized sound output will need to be topped and tailed.
The CDP functions <a href="cgrohous.htm#EXTRACT"><b>HOUSEKEEP EXTRACT 3</b></a> or <a href="cgroenvl.htm#TOPANTAIL2"><b>TOPNTAIL2</b></a> can be used for this, but many sound editors also have this facility.
