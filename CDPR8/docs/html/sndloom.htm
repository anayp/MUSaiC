<a name="WBASIC">Workspace 1: &nbsp;Basic Operation
</h2>

<blockquote>

<h3>
<a name="WLAUNCH">Upon Launching</a>
</h3>

<blockquote>
On launching the Sound Loom you will find yourself on the <b>Workspace 
Page</b>.  This consists of three panels, the 
<a href="#WCHOOSE"><b>Chosen Files</b></a> panel, the <b>Workspace</b> panel,
and the <a href="#WPUT"><b>Source Directory</b></a> panel.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>The outline mode of operation of this page is as follows..
<ul>
<p>
<li>Select directories from which you wish to source files and 
list their files on the <i>Source Directory</i> panel. 
</p>
<p>
<li>Load the files you want to use in the session from the <i>Source Directory</i> 
onto the <i>Workspace</i>.
</p>
<p>
<li>Work by selecting individual files (or sets of files) from the <i>Workspace</i> 
and placing them on the <i>Chosen Files</i> list, ready to process.
</p>
<p>
<li>Press the <i>Process</i> button, to launch a CDP process of your choice.
</p>
<p>
<li>When the process is complete, the resulting file(s) will appear at the top 
of the <i>Workspace</i>.
</p>
<p>
<li>Repeat this processing operation, selecting new files to process, or new processes 
to apply to the Chosen Files.
</p>
<p>
<li>On completing your session, <i>store</i> any newly created files you want to keep 
by copying them into a directory of your choice.
</ul></b>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
The central panel, the <b>Workspace</b>, is a listing of files 
the <i>Sound Loom</i> knows about and will work with. It will  
list the files you intend to work with for the session, and (once you start to work) 
the files that you <i>generate</i> with CDP processes.  Files not listed in the Workspace 
are not known about by the <i>Sound Loom</i> and <i>this prevents you using or overwriting 
files you did not intend to</i>.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
On first running the <i>Sound Loom</i>, the <b>Workspace</b> will be empty. 
You will load file onto the workspace, and create new files as you work.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
At the end of your session there will (usually) be files listed in the 
<b>Workspace</b>, and, when you <a href=#ENDSES><b>end the session</b></a>, 
the <b>Workspace</b> listing is remembered so that next time you start the <i>Sound Loom</i>, 
those listed files will be automatically loaded onto the workspace.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>

<a href="#SLTOPICS"><b>Return</b></a> to <i>Sound Loom</i> Topics.<br>
<a href="ccdpndex.htm" Target="_top" Target="_top" ><b>Return</b></a> to the CDP Master Index.
</blockquote>
</p>
<h3>
<a name="WSOURCE">Getting Sources</a>
</h3>

<blockquote>
To get files onto the workspace (either on your first run, or at any 
subsequent time), you will need to load them from wherever they are 
stored on your computer. How to do this is explained below, in the, 
<a href="#WWSRC"><b>Choosing Sources</b></a> section.
</blockquote>

<h3>
<a name="WGOPROC"><b>Processing Files</b></a>
</h3>

<blockquote>
Having chosen your file(s), you can proceed to process them, using the CDP 
instruments. There are 4 buttons, at the top left of the page, which take 
you to the sound processing stage.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<h3>
Process
</h3>

<blockquote>
The simplest way to proceed is to press <b>Process</b>.  You will then  
find yourself on the <i>Sound Loom</i> <a href="#SLPR"><b>Process Page</b></a> from where you can choose the process you want to apply to the chosen file(s).
</blockquote>

<h3>
Bulk Process
</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>
You can also <b>apply the same process to many files</b>. To do this 
press the <b>Bulk Process</b> button. <i>Bulk processing will only work if all the files on the Chosen Files list are of the same type</i>. You will then find yourself on the <i>Sound Loom</i> <a href="#SLPR"><b>Process Page</b></a> from where you can choose the process you want to apply to each of the chosen files.</p>

<p>
When you run a process on a number of files (i.e., a 'bulk process'), <i>some of the processes may fail</i> for one reason or another, such as by editing a file beyond its end, trying to normalise a file which is already too loud, etc.  Any single process that fails during a bulk run will return a message such as "cannot find channel ..."  When this happens, click on the 'OK' in each box with this type of message until all such message alerts have gone.  Then the <i>Sound Loom</i> page should tell you which of the many processes in the bulk run succeeded and which ones failed.
</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>
Create Instrument
</h3>

<blockquote>
When you know the system well, you can combine a sequence of processes to make 
a single <b>Instrument</b>. 
An Instrument is a sequence of processes with all of their parameters, which runs 
as if it were a single simple process. 
(This is a graphic implementation of the 'batch file' concept).  
See the section on <a href="#SLI">Creating Instruments</a>.
</blockquote>

<h3>
Recall Action
</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>
You can also <b>recall a Process</b> (or an <b>Instrument</b>) that you ran earlier 
in your session, or in a previous session, together with the actual parameters you used. 
To find out how to recall an 'action' in this way, 
see the section on <a href="#SLH">History</a>.

</blockquote>

<h3>
<a name="ENDSES">Ending Your Session</a>
</h3>

<blockquote>
When you have completed your work, you can close down the <i>Sound Loom</i>
by clicking on the <b>End Session</b> button in the top right hand corner 
of the window. This distintively coloured button can be found on most of 
the principal windows in the <i>Sound Loom</i>, so you can close down 
the session at any point in your work.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
On closing down the session, the current state of your work will be <b>remembered</b> 
by the <i>Sound Loom</i>. The listing of files on the workspace, and on the 
chosen files list, the source directory name you were using, any <b>Instruments</b> or  
<b>Patches</b> you created, or <b>Favorites</b> you chose, are stored.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
On next launching the <i>Sound Loom</i>, you will find the system restored to the 
state it was in when you finished your last session. (You will need to press <b>LIST</b> 
on the Source Directory panel to restore the listing of your chosen source directory).
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
If you exit your session in a hurry, you may be asked if you want to store the current 
state of the Workspace. If you say "No", the workspace you loaded at the <i>start</i> of the 
session will be remembered, and hence restored when you start the next session.

<a name="WWSRC">Workspace 2: &nbsp;Choosing Sources</a>
</h2>

<blockquote>
<h3>
<a name="WSRCS">Finding Sources</a>
</h3>

<blockquote>
To get files onto the workspace (either on your first run, or at any 
subsequent time), you will need to load them from wherever they are 
stored on your computer. How to do this is explained below.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
The <i>Sound Loom</i> will only grab files which are CDP-compatible. If 
you try to (perhaps accidentally) transfer files which are not CDP 
compatible (e.g. 'Word' documents) the Sound Loom will ignore them. 
The <i>Sound Loom</i> will also prevent you from accessing any of the CDP 
system directories, so you cannot damage the <i>Sound Loom</i> or 
destroy any information about your current working environment.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
As the sounds are transferred to the workspace list, the <i>Sound Loom</i> 
examines them and makes a note of their properties, for future reference.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Files appear on the workspace listing with their full directory path.
These are referred to as <b>Old Files</b> (i.e. pre-existing files).
Newly created files (and also files <a href=#WCOPY><b>copied</b></a> onto 
the Workspace), appear with <i>no</i> directory path. You can thus quickly 
differentiate the new files you are creating as you work.

<h3>
<a name="WPUT">Specifying a Directory</a>, & Loading Files to Workspace : the Source Directory Panel
</h3>
<blockquote>
	<ol>
	<p>
	<li>Above the Source Directory panel, there is an entry 
	box for a directory name. Click on the <b>Find Directory</b> button above 
	this. A list of directories (and drives) will appear.
	<br>
	Select the directory from which you wish to load files. It will appear in 
	the entry box.
	(Alternatively, you can just type the name of the directory into the entry box). 
	</p>

	<p>
	<li>Now press <b>LIST</b> and choose <b>List Specified Directory</b>. 
	A listing of the files in that directory will appear in the 
	<i>Source Directory</i> Panel.
	</p>

	<p>
	<li><b>Select the files</b> you want to use (soundfiles, analysis 
	files, text files etc.), with the mouse.
	</p>

	<p>
	<li>Then press <b>GRAB</b> and choose <b>Use Selected Files on Workspace</b>. 
	The files will then be listed in the workspace.
	</p>
	</ol>

<h3>
Alternative ways to list and grab files for the workspace
</h3>

	<ul>
	<p>
	<li><b>Grab All Files in the directory</b>. You can grab all the (valid) files in the directory. Press 
	<b>LIST</b> and choose <b>Use All Files on Workspace</b>.
	</p>
	<p>
	<li><b>Grab Files from a  Subdirectory</b>. There may be subdirectories inside 
	the directory you have listed in the Source Directory panel. 
	If so, their names will appear in that listing.
	You can list the contents of such a subdirectory by selecting its name 
	with the mouse, pressing <b>LIST,</b> and choosing <b>List Subdirectory</b>.
	<br>
	To return to the original directory listing, press <b>LIST</b> and 
	choose <b>Ascend Directory Tree</b>. (in fact you can ascend the 
	directory tree at any stage, until you reach the root directory of 
	the drive your are examining).
	</p>
	<p>
	<li><a name="WCOPY"><b>Copy Files</b></a>. The Grab process does not 
	usually copy files. The files are simply listed on the workspace 
	as files the workspace knows about and will work with. 
	If you really want to <b><i>copy</i></b> a file from your chosen 
	directory into the workspace <i>directory</i>, press <b>LIST</b> and choose 
	<b>Copy selected files and Use Copies</b>.
	<br>
	(A file which is actually <i>in</i> the Workspace <i>directory</i> will be listed 
	with <i>just its name</i>. Other files are listed <i>with their directory 
	path</i>, so you can see which directory they are in).
	</p>
	<p>
	<li><b>Get Files with similar names</b>.You can grab or <a href="#WCOPY">copy</a> 
	files which have similar names. Press <b>LIST</b> and 
	choose <b>Choose Files with Generic Name</b> or <b>Copy Files with Generic Name</b>.
	<br>
	A dialogue box will appear where you can enter details of the name, and various 
	other information about the choice of files.

<h3>
<a name="WOTH">Other Source Directory Options</a>
</h3>

	<ul>
	<p>
	<li><b>Limiting the Sample Rate of acceptable source files</b>. If you have 
	decided to do all your work at a particular sampling rate, you can select 
	(or change) that sampling rate using the <b>SRATE</b> button. 
	For example, if you select 48000, then the <b>Grab</b> and <b>Copy</b> buttons 
	will only grab soundfiles etc. with sample rate 48000 (or, in the case of analysis 
	files etc., files derived from soundfiles of sampling rate 48000).
	<br>
	Soundfiles at other sampling rates will be ignored.
	<br>
	Textfiles are not affected by choice of sampling rate.
	</p>
	<p>
	<li><b>Refreshing the Source Directory display</b>. You can refresh the 
	Source Directory display by pressing <b>Refresh</b>. This is useful if you are 
	changing the contents of the directory <i>outside</i> the CDP.
	</p>
	<p>
	<li><b>Deleting an entire source directory</b>. At the end of a project, you may wish
	to clear out a working directory. Or you may create temporary directories, for
	sound experimentation, during the course of your work, and then wish to
	get rid of the files they contain. <br>The <b>DESTROY ALL</b> button allows
	you to do this, but use with care! (If you press this button you will 
	receive a message asking you to confirm that you really do want to 
	destroy the files. This is to prevent your destroying the contents of 
	a directory by accident).

<h2>
<a name="WFILEMAN">Workspace 3: &nbsp;File management</a>
</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>
On the workspace you can perform various file management tasks:
</p>

<h3>
<a name="WGEN">General Features of Workspace File Management</a>
</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Workspace Counters</b>. The workspace is headed by two counters. 
The one on the left counts all the files on the workspace, while the 
one on the right counts any newly created files. If the workspace has a 
very large number of files on it, these counters
change colour to warn you. (It is better to tidy up the workspace from
time to time, as intermediate files, or sounds you made but decided
not to use further, tend to accumulate as work progresses).
</p>
<p>
<b>Storing and Retrieving a Workspace Listing</b>. Sometimes you may decide
 to work on an entirely new batch of source files, while intending to 
return to the current sources at a later date. You can <b>Store</b> the 
current workspace listing, and <b>Recall</b> it (or some other stored 
listing) at a later date, using the checkbuttons at the top of the Workspace.
(Do not be tempted to click the store button many times at one go - the listing is 
stored on each click, and you will only generate many copies of the list).
Listings are stored with their date of storage as a name.
<p>
</blockquote>

<h3>
<a name="WSTORE">Store New Files</a>
</h3>

<blockquote>
<b>Putting newly created files into named directories:</b>  Once a file 
has been created and listed on the workspace it can be placed in a named 
directories.  This can be an existing directory (perhaps having the name 
of your composition, or the name of a section of a piece), or a new 
directory you wish to create.  Simply select one or more files with the 
mouse, type a directory name into the entry box, and press 
<b>STORE NEW FILES</b>.<br>
(You can move files from one directory to another using <b>Move the Selected Files</b> 
on the <a href="#WWOPSEL"><b>PROCESS SELECTED FILES</b></a> menu).
 
	<ul>
	<p>
	<li><b>Why back-up to Directories?</b> &#150; It is advisable to move files into 
	directories as a way of documenting your compositional process.  
	Once hundreds of files have been generated it becomes difficult to 
	keep track of which files came from what process of musical 
	exploration, and, more mundanely, one runs out of new names for 
	sounds.
	</p>
	<p>
 	<li><b>Refreshing Mixfiles</b> &#150; When you move a file into 
	a directory, the <i>Sound Loom</i> can deal with any associated 
	mixfiles it can find.  A mixfile is a set of instructions for 
	mixing soundfiles.  It contains the names of those soundfiles 
	(together with other mixing data).  When you put a file into a 
	directory you are renaming it, so any mixfile that uses that sound,
	(or a sound with the <i>new</i> name) needs to be changed or
	checked. (This is true when you simply give a new name to a 
	file on the workspace. See <a href="#WOPSEL">Operations on Selected Files</a>).
	<br>
	The Sound Loom can check through the Workspace looking for any mixfiles 
	which might contain the named file and either rename the files 
	inside the mixfiles, or ask for your advice on what to do with 
	the mixfiles it finds.
	<br>
	Select the <b>Refresh Mixfiles</b> checkbutton to launch this option.
	<p>
	Mixfile checking does <b>not</b> happen automatically. If you abandon 
	a session in which mixfiles have been used or altered without launching 
	this option, you will receive a warning, enabling you to launch the 
	option before concluding the session.
	</p>
	</ul>

<h3>
<a name="WUNMARK">Unmark Files
</h3>

<blockquote>
When you select <b>Workspace</b> files with the mouse, they are highlighted.  
You can choose as many files as you want.  If you have selected several 
<b>Workspace</b> files with the mouse, but then change your mind, pressing 
<b>Unmark Files</b> will remove the highlighting from these files.
</blockquote>

<h3>
<a name="WCLEAR">Clear Old Files on Workspace
</h3>

<blockquote>
If you decide to start with a fresh set of source files, the <b>CLEAR OLD FILES</b> 
button will clear the Workspace listing of all files which 
show a directory path.  <b>It does not delete the 
files from your disk</b>.  Files which do <i>not</i> have a directory path 
are in the workspace <i>directory</i> itself. These are files you have created with 
CDP processes (and not subsequently backed-up into directories), or files you have 
<a href="#WCOPY"><b>Copied</b></a> (rather than <b>Grabbed</b>) onto the Workspace.  
This prevents you losing sight of files you have created.  If you want to 
clear the workspace completely, you should put the remaining files into 
a named directory as described in <a href="#WSTORE"><b>Store New 
Files</b></a> above (or <a href="#WDEL">delete them from the disk</a>).

<a name="WCHOOSE">Workspace 5: &nbsp;Choosing Files to Process</a>
</h2>

<blockquote>

To use the CDP processes in the <i>Sound Loom</i> you first put a file 
(or files) on the <b>Chosen Files</b> list, then Process it (them), 
by pressing the <b>Process</b> button, which takes you to the 
<a href="#SLPR"><b>Process Page</b></a>.

<h3>
To Choose Files to Process
</h3>

<blockquote>
	<ol>
	<p>
	<li>Press <b>Enter Chosen Files Mode</b>.  The Workspace now changes to 
	<i>Choose Files mode</i>, the <b>Chosen Files</b> list is 
	highlighted, and the workspace ceases to be highlighted. The
	workspace menus are no longer operational.
	</p>
	<p>
	<li>When you now select a file on the workspace with the mouse, 
	it will appear in the 'CHOSEN FILES' list to the left.
	</p>
	<p>
	<li>You can 'un-choose' a file listed 
	in the chosen-files list simply by clicking on it in the 
	chosen files list, (or in the workspace list).
	</p>
	<p>
	<li>You can return  to <b>Workspace Mode</b> at any time, by 
	pressing <b>Return to Workspace Mode</b>. the Workspace is now
	highlighted, and the Chosen Files list ceases to be highlighted.
	You can now use all the workspace menus again. The 'Chosen Files' menus are 
	now <i>not</i> operational.
	</p>
	</ol>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
The <b>Chosen Files</b> listing has a file counter at the top. You can also 
<b>Store</b> the current listing, and then <b>Recall</b> it at a later time. 
(You can recall the <i>immediately</i> previous listing from 
the <b>SPECIAL CHOICE</b> button, see below).

	<blockquote>
	The <b>Reorder</b> button will allow you to reverse or rotate the 
	order of files in the <b>Chosen Files</b> list.  (The order of files 
	submitted to some processes is significant: &nbsp;e.g. with 2 pitch

	the <i>type</i> of the file you have selected e.g. if you attempt to process 
	a file, which you think is a soundfile, but the Workspace offers no 
	soundfile-processing programs for you to use, either it is not a soundfile

When you click on the <b>Process</b> button on the <b>Workspace</b>. 
The <b>Process Page</b> is displayed.  The main feature of the <b>Process 
Page</b> is a set of large buttons which give you access to different types 
of CDP processes, such as Filtering, or Grain Manipulation. The <i>Sound

</p>

<p>
When you press one of these highlighted buttons, a menu of possible 
processes will be posted on the Current Menu window, to the left of the

When you select a particular process from a menu, the <b>Parameters Page</b> 
will appear.  Some processes have no parameters and you need only press 
<b>Goto Run</b>.  However, more typically, a process has a number of 
parameters which you can set before you run the process.  These parameters 
are listed on the <b>Parameters Page</b>.  For each parameter you will see 
its name e.g. 'CYCLE-GROUP CNT' and an entry display mechanism, or 'gadget'.

</p>

</blockquote>

<h2>
<a name="PAGADGET">Parameters 2: &nbsp;Parameter Gadgets
</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>
There are various kinds of parameter gadgets, from a single checkbox 
(determining whether a parameter is set or not), to an array of 
radio-buttons (e.g. for setting sampling rate) where you must choose one 
of the proffered values, to parameters with a full range of values.  
</p>

<p>
These latter parameter gadgets have some or all of these features...
</p>

	<ul>
	<p>
	<li><a name="PARANGE"><b>Range Display</b></a> &#150; On the left 
	you will find a display of the available range.  Some parameters 
	allow you to change this range.  Press the <b>Range</b> button, and 
	the available <b>Range</b> will toggle between a standard range, 
	and a larger, complete range.  Whichever range you choose, the 
	slider bar, and the breakpoint editor (more below) will operate 
	over that range.
	</p>
	<p>
	<li><a name="PABOX"><b>Value Entry Box</b></a> &#150; You may type 
	in the value of the parameter you want (or the name of a breakpoint 
	file you wish to use). The <i>Sound Loom</i> will check the validity 
	of your entry (e.g. is the numerical value within range, are 
	breakpoint files valid at all for this parameter, is the name you've 
	entered the name of a file, is the file a breakpoint file of the 
	appropriate range for this process and the soundfile you are working 
	on etc.).
	</p>
	<p>
	<li><a name="PASLIDER"><b>Slider Bar</b></a> &#150; You can also 
	enter a value by sliding the slider bar.  Due to the limitations of 
	screen resolution you may not be able to get exactly the value you 
	want with the slider bar.  In that case, you can fix it definitively 
	in the entry box.
	</p>
	<p>
	<li><a name="PAPCHVALS"><b>Exact pitch values of frequency</b></a> 
	&#150; Where frequency values are being entered, you may see an 
	additional box indicating the pitch corresponding to the entered 
	frequency.  Where the frequency is not close to a pitch value, the 
	pitch value will be greyed out.  If you want to force the frequency 
	value to correspond exactly to the displayed pitch, press the exact 
	button.
	</p>
	<p>
	<li><a name="PABRKFILES"<b>Getting an existing breakpoint 
	file</b></a> &#150; You can often use a time-varying value (instead 
	of a fixed value) for a parameter.  Pressing <b>Get File</b> will 
	offer you a list of appropriate breakpoint files to use (i.e. files 
	whose values lie within the range set for this parameter with the 
	sound (or other) file(s) you have currently chosen).  You can also 
	get access to any other breakpoint file on the workspace by pressing 
	the <b>See All</b> button on this listing.  From the list you can 
	select a file with the mouse and press <b>Use</b> (it if is a 
	relevant file) or press <b>Edit</b> to go into the textfile or 
	breakfile editor (see below).
	</p>
	<p>
	<li><a name="PABRKNEW"><b>Making a new breakpoint file</b></a> &#150; 
	You can also create a breakpoint file from scratch.  Press <b>Make 
	File</b> and follow the instructions.  Full details are in the 
	<a href="#SLB">	<b>Breakpoint Tables</b></a> section.
	</p>
	</ul>


<b>Get File</b> and <b>Make File</b> are geared into the properties of 
the sound (or other) file(s) you chose from the Workspace and the process 
you are running, i.e. they know how long your input file is, and what the 
range of the selected parameter is when working with your chosen file(s).  
They automatically tie the range and duration of the breakpoint file you 
are creating (or editing) to these values.  (You can also override these 
constraints if you want).
<p>
Sometimes  a <b>Standard Features</b> button will appear when you are 
creating a textfile. Click on this 
to see what type of values are required as data. (Don't forget to delete 
the standard features information before saving the file).

<h2>
<a name="PARESETTING">Parameters 3: &nbsp;Resetting Parameter Values
</h2>

<blockquote>
Each parameter has 3 small buttons attached to it.
	<ol>
	<p>
	<li><a name="PARESETS"><b>Reset</b></a> &#150; This button resets 
	the value of the parameter to where it was when you last started 
	work on this <b>Parameters Page</b>.  For example, if you have a 
	number of parameters, and intend to alter just one of them, but 
	change the wrong one by mistake, <b>Reset</b> will return it to 
	its outset value.
	</p>
	<p>
	<li><a name="PADEFAULTS"><b>Default</b></a> &#150; This button will 
	return the parameter to the CDP default value for that parameter.
	</p>
	<p>
	<li><a name="PALASTRUNS"><b>LastRun</b></a> &#150; If you have run 
	this process (immediately) before, this button will return the 
	parameter to the value it had on the previous run of the process.
	</p>
	</ol>

At the head of the display you will also find three buttons which have the 
same function but applied to all the parameters.  These are <b>Reset All 
Values</b>, <b>Set All Defaults</b>, and <b>Penultimate Run Vals</b>.

<h3>
<a name="PAPATCHES">Patches
</h3>

<blockquote>
Saving and Using favourite parameter settings: <b>Patches</b>.  You can 
save, as a patch, the particular parameter values you have set for the 
process, and hence use them again at a later time (it will also be 
remembered when you close down the session, so you can use it in a 
subsequent session).  Simply press the <b>Save</b> button above the 
<b>PATCHES</b> listing, and give your patch a name.  When you run this 
process again, your patch will be listed (only patches relevant to the 
current process appear in the patches listing display).  To use the 
patch, simply select it with the mouse and press <b>Load</b>.  The 
parameters will be loaded with the patch values.  You can also 
<b>Delete</b> a patch here.  (Sometimes a previously stored patch may 
turn out not to work with the current file you are using.  For example 
if the patch sets an editing point at 3 seconds, and your current file 
is only 2 seconds long, it will not work.  The <i>Sound Loom</i> will 
inform you of such anomalies.)
</blockquote>

<h3>
<a name="PAPLAYSRC">Play source
</h3>

<blockquote>
Playing the source file e.g. to compare it with the output file.  The 
<b>Play Source</b> button allows you to do this.  If there is more than 
one source soundfile you will be offered a Playlist, and you can select 
which file to play ... if there are no playable input files, the 
<b>Play Source</b> button will not respond.
</blockquote>

<h3>
<a name="PAEDITSRC">Edit Source Data

<blockquote>
With some processes (e.g. those using mixfiles or envelopes) a further 
button, <b>Edit Src</b>, is displayed. You can use this to go to a 
window where you can edit the mix or envelope data, if you are dissatisfied 
with the output of the process.

<h2>
<a name="BMAKEEDIT">Making or Editing a Breakpoint Table File</a>
</h2>

<blockquote>
<h3>
<a name="BRANGEDUR">Range and Duration</a>
</h3>

<blockquote>
The range of values for the breakpoint table will be determined by the 
range of the parameter itself (remember that in some cases you can toggle 
between two different ranges for the parameter .. do this on the parameter 
gadget before creating the breakpoint  table).  Usually the duration of 
the breakpoint table is also determined by the duration of the soundfile 
(or other type of file) to which the process is to be applied.  However 
in some cases you will be asked to enter a duration for the breakpoint 
table (in seconds). (You can often override this duration later).
</blockquote>

<h3>
<a name="BSELECT">Selecting a table to use</a>
</h3>

<blockquote>
If you want to use an existing breakpoint table, you will be presented 
with a list of breakpoint table files.  The display shows only those 
files which are appropriate (have the appropriate range) to apply to the 
parameter you are working on.  If you just want to use one of these files, 
select it with the mouse, and press <b>Use</b>.
<p>
You can even select a table which is not wholly appropriate to 
the current parameter (or to the current file chosen from 
the workspace).   Press <b>See All</b> and you will see a listing 
of all the breakpoint table files currently on the workspace.
</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>
<a name="BEDIT">Editing an existing table</a>
</h3>

<blockquote>
If you want to edit the table before you use it, select it with the mouse, 
and press <b>Edit</b>.    You may select any table and press <b>Edit</b>.  
You may now be asked if you want to modify the upper or lower range of the 
existing table in order to display it inside the range appropriate to the 
current parameter.  If you choose to do this, the table will be 
appropriately modified before being displayed.
	<p>
	<b>The Graphic Display</b>: You will now be given a window in which the 
	value of the parameter is ranged from bottom to top, and the time 
	dimension from left to right.  If you are making a table, two 
	points, connected by a line will already have been drawn on the 
	screen.  If you are editing an existing table, that table will be 
	displayed in the window.  You can edit this display with the 
	mouse (for more information press the button <b>Mouse Options</b>).  
	Note that you can alter the end-points of the graph by clicking the 
	mouse outside the display area.

<h3>
<a name="BMASKS">Masks</a>
</h3>

<blockquote>
If you are <i>editing</i> an existing table, that table may be longer than 
the sound (or other) file to which you are going to apply it.  In this case 
the graphic display will extend only part way across the screen, and the 
remainder of the screen will be masked (it will appear in a different 
colour).  You can remove this mask (and subsequently restore it) with 
options on the <b>Options</b> menu.
	<p>
	<blockquote>
	If the table is too long for the soundfile, the part of the 
	breaktable which does not affect the soundfile will be masked off.  
	Again you can remove or restore this mask from the Options menu.
	</blockquote>

</blockquote>

<h3>
<a name="BTIME">Remove time constraints</a>
</h3>

<blockquote>
Usually, the duration of a breakpoint table will be determined by the 
duration of the sound (or other) file to which it is to be applied.  However, 
you can override this restriction with the <b>Remove Time Constraints</b> 
option on the <b>Options</b> menu.  (You can subsequently restore the time 
constraints in the same way).

<p>
There are some global operations you can perform on the table, found in the 
<b>Options</b> menu.
</p>

<blockquote>

<h3>
<a name="BRANGE">Range Options
</h3>
	<ol>
	<p>
	<li><b>Fill Value Range</b> &#150; You can force the graphic display 
	to use the whole vertical dimension of the screen by selecting 
	<b>Fill Value Range</b> on the <b>Options</b> menu.
	</p>
	<p>
	<li><b>Extend Value Range</b> &#150; You can extend the value range 
	of the display (but not beyond the range set for the parameter) by 
	selecting <b>Extend Value Range</b> on the <b>Options</b> menu.  
	This is useful if you use <b>Fill Value Range</b> (using up the 
	whole screen for the existing range of values) and then decide to 
	extend the range of the table.
	</p>
	<p>
	<li><b>Previous Value Range, Original Value Range</b> &#150; You 
	can backtrack to the previous range of values, or to the original 
	range of values by selecting these options on the <b>Options</b> 
	menu.
	</p>
	<p>
	<li><b>Log Display&#47;Linear Display</b> &#150; The breaktable 
	will initially be displayed either linearly or logarithmically, 
	according to which parameter is being displayed.  You can toggle 
	between a linear and a logarithmic display using this option on 
	the <b>Options</b> menu.
	</p>
	</ol>

<h3>
<a name="BDURATION">Duration Options
</h3>
	<ol>
	<p>
	<li><b>Lengthen, Shorten table</b> &#150; You can lengthen the 
	table (adding an extra point beyond the current end point, or 
	cutting the table at a specified time) with the <b>Lengthen 
	Table</b> and <b>Shorten Table</b> options on the <b>Options</b> 
	menu.
	</p>
	<p>
	<li><b>Timestretch, Timeshrink table</b> &#150; You can expand or 
	contract the whole table to a given duration (e.g. to 2 seconds 
	total duration), or by a given factor (e.g. multiply the current 
	duration by two).  Here the whole table is expanded or contracted.  
	The points stay in the same relation to one another but are laid 
	out over a longer (or shorter) duration.  The table will look 
	exactly the same, but you will notice that the end time coordinate 
	(at the bottom right of the window) has changed.
	</p>
	<p>
	<li><b>Restore the Original Timings</b> &#150; You can restore the 
	original timings using the <b>Original Timings</b> options on the 
	<b>Options</b> menu.  For a table you are <b>Making</b> this will be 
	just the start (0.0) and end (duration) times of the original table 
	specification.  When editing an existing table, it will be the 
	original time-points of the table.  If you have changed the <i>number 
	of points</i> in the table, this may lead to some unusual 
	transformations of the table.

order, or outside the range specified for the parameter.
</blockquote>

</blockquote>

<h2>
<a name="BDISPLAY">Display Resolution</a>
</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>
The computer screen display can only resolve the value of points down to 
the nearest pixel.  If you have a fairly (time) dense display of points, 
and you lengthen the table, it's possible for these points to be crammed 
so closely together (in time) that they can no longer be differentiated 
on the screen display.  Similarly, a table you choose to edit may also 
not be (time) resolvable on the screen.

an Instrument using the Phase Vocoder (PVOC) to analyse an input soundfile 
followed by Time Stretching of the analysis file produced, you might want 
to make the value of Time-Stretch a variable in the Instrument, but keep 
the number of analysis channels fixed, so that it is not accessible to

<blockquote>
Once your Instrument is complete, press <b>Conclude</b>.  You will first be 
presented with a list of all the files (including the intermediate files) 
produced by the <b>Instrument</b> you have created.  (You can tell which 
file is which by reference to the tree diagram).  You may save any or all 
of these files, and will be asked to give names to them.  <i>If you save none 
of the files the Instrument will be aborted.</i>  This is because the choice 
of which files to keep and which to delete is part of the description of 
the Instrument.  An Instrument which keeps no files is not a very useful 
Instrument!
</blockquote>
 	<ul>
	<p>
	<li><b>Naming the Instrument</b> &#150; Finally you will be asked 
	to name the Instrument.  The <i>Sound Loom</i> with then return to 
	normal working mode, and the Instrument's name will appear in the 
	Instruments listing on the <b>Process Page</b>.  You can then run 
	the Instrument (provided you supply it with appropriate files) by 
	selecting it with the mouse and running it as if it were an ordinary 
	process (see below).
	</p>
	<p>
	<li><b>Instrument predictability</b> &#150; Instruments are not 
	quite so robust as simple processes.  This is because, when you 
	run a <i>process</i>, you give it a specific file or files, and from the 
	properties of these files it can determine what range its parameters 
	should have, and prevent you from entering inappropriate values.
	</p>
	<p>
	The first process of an Instrument works in just the same 
	way, but subsequent processes may use the outputs of earlier 
	processes as their inputs.  The Instrument must then predict 
	the properties of those intermediate files in order to 
	determine what the ranges of the parameters for the later 
	processes are.
	</p>
	<p>
	This prediction is not always possible.  Hence some 
	processes, and some kinds of parameters cannot be used in 
	Instruments (the <i>Sound Loom</i> will inform you of this 
	if you try to use them).  A valid Instrument may also refuse 
	to run with the files you have chosen, <i>even when they are 
	of the correct type</i>, if it has a fixed parameter value 
	lying outside the range set by the new input files you 
	are using.  Or it may ask you for an appropriate parameter 
	range where you will be <i>entering</i> a parameter value 
	for the Instrument, but the range of that parameter cannot 
	be predicted.  Occasionally an Instrument may even turn out 
	to be non-viable in most cases!

<blockquote>
Instruments are listed in the right hand window on the <b>Process Page</b>.  
You can run an <b>Instrument</b> by selecting it with the mouse and 
pressing <b>Run</b>.
	<p>
	<blockquote>
	In  general, running an Instrument is exactly the same as running 
	a process.  There are just one or two factors to bear in mind.
	</blockquote>
	</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>
<a name="ICHOOSE">Choosing the input files to an Instrument</a>
</h3>

<blockquote>
To run an Instrument you must have chosen appropriate files from the 
<b>Workspace</b>, just as when running a simple process.  The 
<b>Instrument</b> will check to see if you have chosen the correct 
number of input files, of the correct type (and in the correct order, 
if there is more than one type).
</blockquote>

<h3>
<a name="ISEE">See Instrument tree diagram</a>
</h3>

<blockquote>
If you cannot remember what number, type or order of files to use, select 
the <b>Instrument</b> from the Listing and press <b>See</b>.  The tree 
diagram (see above) of the Instrument will be displayed.
	<ul>
	<li>The input files to the Instrument are the files appearing in the 
	top row of the display.
	<li>The type of each file can be read from the Key at the top of the 
	display.
	<li>The order of the input files to choose is read from left to right.
	</ul>
</blockquote>

<h3>
<a name="ISET">Set parameter values for Instrument</a>
</h3>

<blockquote>
If you set any of the parameters as variable (see above) when the 
<b>Instrument</b> was created, you will get a <b>Parameters Page</b> 
(just as with a simple process) on which you can enter values for the 
Instrument parameters.
<p>
The parameter names will now indicate which process (within the 
instrument) they are connected with.  (The process number occurs 
alongside the parameter name, and corresponds to the process number 
shown on the tree diagram).
</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>
<a name="IDEFAULTS">Default parameter values</a>
</h3>

<blockquote>
When you create an <b>Instrument</b>, the values you use for its parameter 
are taken to be the <i>default settings</i> for the <b>Instrument</b>.  If 
the parameter is set as <i>variable</i>, the value you first see on the 
Instrument's <b>Parameters Page</b> is this default value.
	<ul>
	<p>
	<li>Sometimes the Instrument default value (for fixed <i>or</i> 
	variable parameters) will be inappropriate for the new input 
	file(s) you are using.  The <i>Sound Loom</i> will inform you of 
	this and revert to the CDP default value.
	</p>
	<p>
	<li>Each parameter gadget now also has an extra small button, 
	labelled <b>Original</b>.  If you press the <b>Default</b> button for 
	an Instrument parameter, you will reset the parameter to the 
	Instrument default value.  If the instrument default value is 
	outside the range appropriate for the current chosen file, the 
	<b>Default</b> button reverts to setting the CDP default.  If you 
	press the <b>Original</b> button, you will get the CDP default value.
	</p>
	<p>
	<li>Correspondingly, at the top of the display, the <b>Set All 
	Defaults button</b> is now replaced by two buttons,  <b>Instrument 
	Defaults</b> (which sets all the parameters, to the default settings 
	for the Instrument), and <b>Original Defaults</b> (which sets all 
	the parameters to their CDP default settings).
	</p>
	<p>
	<li>Sometimes you will be asked to specify limits to the range of 
	the parameters for an <b>Instrument</b> (see above, Instrument 
	Predictability).  Occasionally, no values at all will turn out 
	to be appropriate or the instrument will declare itself to be 
	'non-predictable' and refuse to run.
	</p>
	</ul>
</blockquote>

<h3>
<a name="IPATCH">Instrument Patches</a>
</h3>

<blockquote>
You can also save a set of Instrument parameters as a <b>Patch</b> (just as 
with a simple process).  On running an <b>Instrument</b> for which patches 
exist, the patches for that <b>Instrument</b> will be displayed on the 
<b>Parameters Page</b>, and can be used in the normal way.

<h2 align=center><a name="BATCHINTRO">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>
The <b>Run Batchfile</b> button on the Workspace will take you to the 
<b>Batch File Processing Window</b>.
</p>
<p>
<b>This has been created <i>primarily</i> to allow you to run
any batchfiles you previously created with the commandline version of the CDP software.</b>
</p>
<p>
Batch File processing is <a href="#ROBUST"><b>not as robust</b></a> as the rest of the <i>Sound Loom</i>.<br>
You are therefore advised, whenever possible, to use the <b>Bulk Process</b> or 
<b>Instrument</b> facilities instead.<br>Bulk Process will allow you to run the same process on a 
large number of files, all at one go.<br>Instruments can be created to run a sequence 
of CDP processes on a set of input files, all in one go. Instruments can either have 
fixed (pre-specified) parameters, or allow access to some (or all) of the parameters 
of their constituent processes (see the section on <i>Instruments</i>).<br>
However, <a href="#BATCHNEW">in certain circumstances</a>, only a batchfile will do the job.
</p>
<p>
Batchfile processing is always preceded by a <b>Workspace Update</b> (checking all 
workspace files and their properties). This helps ensure that your batchfile-process 
will not overwrite existing Workspace files<br>             
If you have a large number of files on the workspace, this may take a little time.
</p>
<p>
When the batchfile is <a href="#BATCHRUN"><b>run</b></a>, <b>batchfile messages may not 
be displayed immediately</b>. (With a long batchfile you may have to wait some 
time before you see anything).
</p>
<p>
If your batchfile runs successfuly you will find the outputfiles listed on the Workspace, 
<i>except for files created by indirection</i> (using  '>' or '>>' to pipe 
the output of a process into a file). In the latter case, you will need to 
run <b>Update Workspace Filedata</b> from the <b>Process All Files</b> menu on the Workspace, 
to see the outputfile.

<h2 align=center><a name="ROBUST">Lack of Robustness</h2></a>
<p>
<b><u>The syntax of your batchfile is not checked</b></u>.
</p>
With a long batchfile, where the same (set of) process(es) is repeated many times, 
it is wise to test your batchfile's <a href="#BATCHSYN">syntax</a> by creating, 
and trying to run, a short version which uses just one (set of) process(es), to test the syntax.
</p>
<p>
If you make a syntax error, you will usually receive an error message in 
the <i>Sound Loom</i> Run window. However, <b>Tcl error messages may occur</b>. 
These will appear in separate Warning Windows, and you must acknowledge these,
by clicking 'OK' in (all) the Warning dialog(s), to proceed.
</p>
<p>
Syntax errors in the midst of long batchfiles, or too many successive 
syntax errors may <b>stall the <i>Sound Loom</i></b>.
In case of a stall, kill the process in the usual way for your system, 
(<i>Control-Alt-Delete</i> in Windows) and restart the Sound Loom. 
(You may then find some files from the aborted batchfile are now on the Workspace).
</p>
<p>
<b><u>You cannot terminate a batchfile process before it has completed</b></u>
</p>
<p>
...except by killing the process, and hence closing the <i>Sound Loom</i>.
Even if the first process in the batch fails, the batchfile will continue to (try to) run all the other 
processes you have listed before allowing you to return to the Batchfile Window 
for editing. This is another reason to ensure that your <a href="#BATCHSYN">syntax</a> 
is correct 
before launching a batchfile.

<h2 align=center><a name="BATCHNEW">When and How to Use <i>New</i> Batchfiles</a></h2>

<p>
In some cases, neither Bulk Processing or Instruments may be adequate to your needs.<br> 
For example, if you want to run the same process, or sequence of processes, 
on a very large number of files, but <i>with different parameters</i>  for each file, 
and you do not want to manually enter each parameter-set in turn, 
then a batchfile is the only way to proceed.
</p>
<p>
Hence, you may run <i>newly created</i> batchfiles, using the <a href="#BATCHSYN">syntax</a> 
of the commandline version of the CDP.
</p>
<p>
You can type batchfile data directly into the lower panel of the Batchfile Window.
</p>
<p>
You can also <b>edit</b> <a href="#BATCHLOAD">pre-existing batchfiles</a>.
</p>
<p>
'<b>rem</b>' '<b>echo</b>' '<b>del</b>' '<b>rmsf</b>' and comment lines beginning with 
'<b>#</b>' or '<b>@</b>' can be handled,<br>but other non-CDP processes <i>may</i> cause problems.
</p>
<p>
Indirection (using '>' or '>>' to pipe the output of a process into a named 
datafile) can be used.<br>
<i>It will generate an error message, but</i> the data will be found in the 
datafile you specified (if the process runs correctly).
<br>However, this datafile will not be listed on the workspace.
(You must <i>Update Workspace Filedata</i> from the <i>Process All Files</i> menu on 
the Workspace, to see the outputfile on the workspace).
