The degree to which the filter focuses tightly on the bands 
determines how much one hears pitches:  i.e., high <b>Q</b> and 
narrow bands.  With lower <b>Q</b> and wider bands, more of 
the original sound 'comes through'.  'Q' is the focus of the

Boosting instead of cutting achieves the opposite effect: boost below 
emphasises the lower frequencies, boost above emphasises the higher 
frequencies, and boost around creates an area of resonance.  The roll-off 
slope is known as <i>Q</i>.  Perhaps professional engineers know why.<br />

<b>FOCUS FOLD</b><br />[TD]</td>

timbre of the sound because the partials are so greatly moved from 
their original pitch levels. Example uses:
	<ul>

	high pitched effects, sometimes like an ethereal wind or high 
	and slightly ringing</li>
	<li>folding frequencies down creates deep, complex tones</li>
	</ul>
In the spectral domain, the frequency and amplitude of each partial is 
known as a result of the FFT analysis.  This function is a good example 
of how this information can be used: in this case, shifting their 
pitch levels such that all the frequencies of the sound end up within 
the specified band.  It is a very interesting function to explore.<br />

thereby creating two 'sidebands', one above and one below 
the original sound.  Example uses:
	<ul>
	<li>make a sound 'hollow' by giving a fairly high 
	value for the modulating frequency, e.g, 1000</li>
	<li>create beat patterns by specifying a very low 
	frequency value, e.g., 5</li>
	<li>enrich the timbre of a sound with a mid-range 
	frequency value, e.g., 100</li>

This process adds timbral edge and variety, and also makes other 
functions more effective because of the additional artefacts

<b>FORMANTS VOCODE</b><br />[SD]</td>
<td>This technique is known as cross-synthesis: the tonal characteristics 
cross from one sound to another.  Example uses:
	<ul>
	<li>one sound moves 'to the tune of another' &#150; not just 
	the normal amplitude contour of the samples as in the time-domain,

	<li>impose vocal speech on other types of sound</li>
	<li>associate the 'wrong' timbre with the performance 
	characteristics of an instrument</li>
	</ul>
The key element is the spectral envelope.  This means the changing pattern 
of the <i>amplitude</i> of the partials contained in the sound.  Thus 
different tone colours are emphasised at different times.  It is this 
changing tone pattern in sound 2 which is imposed on sound 1.  Thus, if 
sound 1 is water and sound 2 is a voice, the timbral rise and fall of the 
voice is heard in the water, i.e., the water 'speaks'.  It is clear, then, 
that this function will work best when sound 2 has very perceptible 
changes in the loudness curve of the tone colour: prominent strong 
frequency components.<br />

<b>MORPH MORPH</b><br />[SD]</td>
<td>Create a transition between the spectra of 2 sounds.  This means 
interpolating, making gradual numerical transitions, between the 
frequency (spectral) content of one sound to that of another.  The 
aim is to hear the timbre, the tone qualities, of the 
2<sup><small>nd</small></sup> sound coming into the 
1<sup><small>st</small></sup> and gradually replacing it.  The two 
sounds need to be reasonably close in pitch and tone for this to 
work effectively.
Example uses:
	<ul>
	<li>make a seamless transition from one sound to another</li>
	<li>bring in the timbre of sound 2 before raising its amplitude</li>
	<li>bring in the (unaltered) sound of sound 2 before making 
	the transition to its timbre</li>
	<li>with the help of other processes, as suggested below, 
	<i>feel</i> sound 1 warp out of shape as it changes into sound 2</li>
	</ul>
The software allows linear (steady) transition or exponential curves 
(getting faster or slower).  The psychoacoustic aspect of audio transitions 
of this nature is still relatively unexplored.  While visual images 
perceptibly distort very easily in the moment of transition, audio 
tends to blend more readily, i.e., it just sounds like a smooth change 
to the 2<sup><small>nd</small></sup> sound.  The Reference Manual 
therefore discusses ways to prepare a perceptible half-way state that 
gets across that a <i>morph</i> is taking place: an alteration, a warping 
of shape, of form.<br />

GAIN is done by multiplying the amplitude values of the sound by

0.5 halves it.  The -32766 to +32767 scale is used.  SNDINFO 
MAXSAMP displays the maximum sample found in a soundfile and 
advises on the highest <i>gain_factor</i> that can be used.

Always starting and ending at amplitude 0 (silence) and allowing 
indefinitely long slopes, this function provides a quick way to 
get a click-&#47;bump-free start and end to the sound.  Longer 
slopes and exploring linear and exponential shapes also provide 
ways to go beyond simple editing to real tonal changes.  This 
can be especially helpful when preparing a sound for use in a 
TEXTURE function, because every iteration in TEXTURE starts 
at the beginning of the sound, unlike the granular functions, 
which move steadily through the sound.<br />

DISTORT SHUFFLE operates on irregular lengths of wavecycle between zero 
crossings, which are both irregular and generally longer.  BLUR SHUFFLE 
operates on windows, which are of a regular length and very tiny.  This 
means that you have to work harder to produce the shuffle effect: such as 
by a longer <b>domain</b>, a more mixed up <b>image</b>, and especially, 
a larger value for <i>groupsize</i> (i.e., repeats of the <b>image</b>).  
The groups of windows are formed <i>before</i> shuffling, so a longer 
section  of sound is affected with each shuffle operation.<br />

Because this is a time-domain transposition, raising the 
pitch level makes the sound shorter as well as higher;  
lowering it makes it longer as well as lower.  While this 
makes voices sound rather artificial, it is very useful 
to get fuller, richer versions of a sound.  Time-varying 
transposition creates <b>glissandi</b> between reasonably separated 
time-points, while instant changes of level can be achieved 
by making two time-points virtually adjacent, such as 2.00 
and 2.01 (they have to be at least slightly different).  Also 
note Mode 5, which enables you to ACCELerate or decelerate a 
sound over time.  The spectral version, REPITCH TRANSPOSE

	time.  The faster it changes, the more a flapping effect 
	is created.</li>
	<li>Low values for <i>frequency</i> and <i>stretch</i> 
	produce modest changes, but higher values whizz it round 
	considerably.</li>
	<li>The perception of the vibrato as a pitch vibrato is most 
	noticeable on clearly pitched sounds, but not so much with 
	more complex sounds, including vocal sounds.  With the 
	latter, the inharmonic qualities are more prominent.</li>
	</ul>
It is easy to go over the top with this function.  Unless a wild 
flutter effect is needed, controlled movement brings out the changes 
it makes more effectively.<br />

<p>
There are now many ways to alter sounds with computer software.  
This toolbox contains a selection of 19 tools, grouped by musical 
task.
</p>

<p>
These tasks work in two different domains, and it is important to 
understand the difference:
	<ol>
	<li><b>the 'time-domain'</b> &#150; operates on 'normal' 
	soundfiles.  These have data stored as a series of 
	'samples', like a string of beads, each of which has 
	a <i>time</i> when it occurs and an <i>amplitude</i>, 
	i.e., how loud it is.  These sonic beads can be 
	rearranged, duplicated or omitted (operations on the 
	<i>time</i> data</li>) or be made louder or softer 
	(operations on the <i>amplitude</i> data &#150; the 
	overall shape of the amplitude contour is called the 
	amplitude 'envelope').

	<li><b>the 'spectral-domain'</b> &#150; operates on 
	'analysis' files.  These have data created by a Fast 
	Fourier Transform (FFT) process, stored in a complex, 
	overlapping way as <i>frequency</i> (perceptible waves) 
	and <i>amplitude</i>, i.e., how loud each perceptible 
	wave is.  <b>To use the spectral-domain functions, a 
	normal soundfile has to be <i>converted</i> ('ANALYSE') 
	to an analysis file.</b>  After running a spectral process, 
	the analysis file has to be <i>converted</i> back to a 
	normal soundfile ('SYNTHESISE').  It is possible to audition 
	an analysis file directly, using Richard Dobson's 
	<a href="csysutil.htm#PVPLAY"><b>PVPLAY</b></a> 
	program, implemented in several ways in <i>Soundshaper</i>.</li>
	</ol>

The table above lists 10 groups of musical tasks, lists the program 
functions which perform them in one way or another, and gives a 
necessarily general description of what to expect as a result.  Follow 
links to the full Reference Manual for a complete explanation of all 
the parameters and how the function works.
