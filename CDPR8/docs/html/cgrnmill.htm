<h2>What is <i>GrainMill</i>?</h2>

<p>
<i>GrainMill</i> has been prepared as the first of CDP's powerful 
programs to have a graphic interface.  It is derived from GRANULA, 
written by Trevor Wishart and available in the CDP System in various 
versions since 1990.  The intention is to make these comprehensive 
facilities for granular synthesis and sound transformation accessible 
to a wider range of users, faster and easier to use.  We are pleased to 
acknowledge the support of the Sonic Arts Network, which kick-started 
this project, the Arts Council of England, which supported the 
preparatory phase with a generous grant, and the Esm&eacute;e 
Fairbairn Charitable Trust, which provided a large grant, enabling us 
to complete the work.
</p>

<p>
<IMG SRC="images/gmgrain.gif" align="center" ALT="[Image of a sonic grain, with 
enveloped ends]"><br>
<i>GrainMill</i> transforms a sound by cutting it into small pieces, 
called <a href="#GRAIN"><b>grains</b></a>, then 
reassembling the grains to reconstruct a new sound.  If we simply cut a 
sound into chunks, then rejoin them end-to-end in the same order, we will 
end up with the sound you started with!  To transform the sound, we need 
to reassemble the grains in a new way.
</p>

<p>
<i>GrainMill</i> provides us with several 'new ways' to explore:  
we can stretch out the original sound in time (<a href="#TIMESTRETCH"><b>TIMESTRETCH)</b></a>, 
we can alter the density of the grains (<a href="#DENSITY"><b>DENSITY</b></a>), we 
can define a 'searchfield' area in the <a href="#INFILE"><b><i>infile</i></b></a> from which to select each grain 
(<a href="#WANDER"><b>WANDER</b></a>), we can change the size (duration) of the grains (<a href="#GRAINSIZE"><b>GRAINSIZE</b></a>), 
we can change the pitch or loudness of each grain (<a href="#PITCH"><b>PITCH</b></a> and 
<a href="#LOUDNESS"><b>LOUDNESS</b></a>), 
and we can move them about in space (<a href="#SPACE"><b>SPACE</b></a>).  Each of these ways to change the sound can be used separately or in combination.
</p>

<hr> <!-- ****************************************************** -->


<h2 id="UNDERSTAND">Getting a basic understanding of <i>GrainMill</i></h2>

<p>
It is useful to appreciate that <i>GrainMill</i> is able to reproduce 
the original sound nearly exactly.  It will do this if the DENSITY is 
at least 2 and no other random factors are called upon.
</p>

<p>
For example one can use <i>GrainMill</i> to perform a simple transposition 
without changing the duration or other sonic characteristics of the 
outfileThe_outfile outfile.  To do this, DENSITY is set to at least 2, 
TIMESTRETCH is set to 1, a fixed PITCH Pitch change is selected and no 
random factors are invoked (e.g., by using RANGE(S)).  The 
original sound will be smoothly reconstructed at a different pitch.  
A somewhat more sophisticated and effective result would be produced 
if DENSITY were set to about 8 (or preferably a Range between 4 and 12), 
and a Range of <a href="#GRAINSIZE">GRAINSIZES</a> was also used.
</p>

<p>
You can create a simple granulation effect by setting DENSITY 
to 1.  Now the grains are end-to-end and one can hear the way the 
<a href="#SPLICESLOPES">SHAPING</a> of the grains causes fluctuations 
in the loudness of each grain.
</p>

<p>
True granular effects begin to occur when DENSITY is much 
higher (e.g, 50 to 200), whereby there will be many grains in 
the <i>outfile</i> where there was just one in the infile.  However, 
to achieve an audible granulation effect, the timing (WANDER) and/or 
pitch level (PITCH) and/or stereo spread (SPACE) needs to be varied 
randomly, in the case of the latter two by using them with the RANGE 
option.  Without these random changes, grains are simply copied onto 
themselves and, however high the DENSITY, the outfile will still sound 
identical to the <i>infile</i>.  When each of these many grains 
is different in e.g. pitch or loudness or source location (WANDER), 
and the sound is also being stretched out considerably, a complex sonic 
stream is produced.
</p>

<p>
<i>GrainMill</i> provides a vast scope of possibilities to explore 
between smooth reconstruction and massively dense, complex textures 
in which the granulation effects are dramatically audible.

<h3 id="EXPLORE">Explore with an adventurous spirit</h3>

<p>
Using the program is straightforward, but requires both careful thought 
and an adventurous spirit, because it offers many and varied 
possibilities.  It is a good idea to explore it freely, trying out 
various settings and combinations of settings 'just to see what 
happens' - and observing just what does happen.  After a time, you 
will observe how certain settings produce certan results, and you will 
then gain more understanding of and control over the results.

</p>


<h3 id="SYSTEMSETTINGS">System Settings</h3>

<p>
There are two main options in the SETTINGS dialog box accessible via 
the Toolbar.  These define the overall system environment in which you 
would prefer to work.
</p>

<p>
The first of the main options concerns <b>how you save the soundfiles 
you make</b>.  This can be done:
	<ul>
	<li>NOT TICKED = 'write directly to named outfile' &#150; You 
	save your soundfiles within the dialog box where you set your 
	parameters.  You can accept the default name written in the 
	output filename box ('OUT' is added to the name of your 
	<i>infile</i>).  Or, you can edit this name to alter it in some 
	way.

	<li>TICKED = 'use the conventional SAVE AS command' (in the FILE 
	drop-down menu) &#150;  Note that this is not enabled until after 
	you have made your sound.  How can the sound be made if it doesn't 
	have a name yet?  A temporary soundfile is made in the system directory allocated for this.
    The advantage of this second Save option is that you 
	can make sounds, alter the parameter settings and remake them 
	over and over until you're happy with the result <b>and then 
	use SAVE AS</b>.  The temporary file is automatically deleted 
	when you exit.
	</ul>
</p>

<p>
The second main option asks you <b>whether or not you want to 'keep the 
dialog visible'</b>.
	<ul>
	<li>NOT TICKED = 'do NOT keep the dialog open when writing and 
	playing sounds' &#150; When you finish adjusting the parameter 
	settings and click on the 'MAKE IT' button, the parameter 
	dialog box disappears.  You can then listen to your sound and 
	Save it (if not already saved &#150; if 'write directly to 
	named outfile' is ticked, you have to save the file before 
	leaving the dialogue box).  To resume work on that sound, 
	go to FILE and OPEN the same input soundfile as before.  Your 
	dialog box, with its previous settings, will reappear.

	<li>TICKED = 'keep the dialog open when writing and playing 
	sounds' &#150; Now when you finish adjusting the parameter 
	settings and click on the 'MAKE IT' button, the parameter 
	dialog box does <b>not</b> disappear.  You can play back the 
	sound using the 'Play Outfile' button on the Toolbar <b> and 
	still be able to see what your parameter settings are.</b>  You 
	can even start to make new changes to the parameter settings 
	while you're still listening to the playback.  In this way 
	you can very quickly fine-tune your sound, moving easily 
	between playback and parameter adjustments.  If you've selected 
	using the conventional SAVE AS command, you don't have to provide 
	a filename until you're completely happy with your sound &#150; 
	and the system takes care of deleting all the temporary soundfiles 
	you've made along the way.
	</ul>

<h3 id="TOOLBAR">Toolbar</h3>

<p>
<IMG SRC="images/gmtoolbar.gif" ALT="[Image of the GrainMill toolbar]">
</p>

<p>
The <b>Toolbar</b> at the top of the window which appears when you 
double-click on <i>GrainMill</i> has 10 facilities:
	<ul>
	<li><b>Open grnfile</b> &#150; The 'grnfile' contains all the 
	parameter settings for a particular sound.  You yourself (or 
	someone else) will have made this file with 'Save Settings'.  
	See <a href="#STARTUP">Startup</a>.  This is the same as LOAD 
	SETTINGS in the FILE drop-down menu.

	<li><b>Save Settings</b> &#150; You can save the whole configuration 
	of settings used to create a particular sound, including the 
	names of any breakpoint files used, as well as the name of the 
	source soundfile.  This saves in a binary file format, and this 
	file can only be opened within <i>GrainMill</i>.

	<blockquote>
	<p>
	<b>Save Settings</b> saves to the currently named .GRN file.<br>
	<b>Save Settings As</b> prompts you for a new filename.
	</p>

	<p>
	<b>NB &#150;</b> When you 'Save Settings' you are asked if you 
	want to associate with the .GRN the soundfile you have been using.  
	Normally, one does <b>not</b> do this.  When you associate 
	the soundfile, the path to this sound on your hard disk is 
	written into the .GRN file.  So it is very specific, and you 
	will not be able to use the same .GRN file with a different 
	sound.
	</p>

	<p>
	Therefore, it is more flexible to save the settings <i>without</i> 
	associating the soundfile.  Then you can use your settings 
	(which includes the names of all the breakpoint files used) 
	with <b>any soundfile</b>.  Remember to Open a Soundfile 
	<b>before</b> Loading a .GRN file which does not have a 
	soundfile associated with it.
	</p>
	</blockquote>

	<li><b>Save As Text</b> &#150; To save your settings as a 
	<b>text file</b> which you can view and edit, use 'Save As Text' 
	in the FILE drop-down menu.

	<li><b>Open sfile</b> &#150; You select your <i>infile</i> and call 
	up the parameter dialog box.

	<li><b>Save Sfile</b> &#150; This save option is only active if 
	you have selected the SAVE AS option in SETTINGS (box unticked).  
	You are prompted to provide a filename for your sound.

	<li><b>Stop processing</b> &#150; You can terminate the production 
	of your <i>outfile</i> if, for example, it's going to take a long 
	time and you can already tell that it is not yet what you want.
	<li><b>Play outfile</b> &#150; Audition the newly made soundfile.
	<li><b>Stop Playback</b> &#150;  Terminate playback if, for example, 
	it's going to take a long time and you can already tell that it 
	is not yet what you want.

	<li><b>Show Dialog</b> &#150; Restores the parameter dialog box 
	to the screen.

	<li><b>Settings</b> &#150; Define the main options of your overall 
	working environment.  See <a href="#SYSTEMSETTINGS">System 
	Settings</a>.

	<li><b>Working directory</b> &#150; Select your working (i.e., 
	'current') directory.  <b>NB:</b> If you have saved .grn files 
	and breakpoint files which you intend to use, these need to be 
	present in your working directory.  It is recommended to maintain 
	separate directories for different projects, to avoid confusion.

</p>

<h3 id="STARTUP">Startup</h3>

<p>
The program is run by double-clicking on the <i>GrainMill</i> icon.  
You then see a title screen with a menu bar on the top.  One begins by 
moving the cursor to FILE and pressing down the left mouse button.  A list 
of options appears.  Then move downwards to the option you want and click 
again.  An option is active when darkened.  Select OPEN in this way, 
to open a soundfile with which to work.
	<p>
	<blockquote>
	(You may need to change directories to get to the directory and 
	sound with which you want to work.  See the select 'Working 
	directory' facility in the <a href="#TOOLBAR">Toolbar</a>.)  
	</blockquote>
	</p>
The existing soundfile which you open in this way and which you will then 
process with <i>GrainMill</i> to make a new sound, is called the 
<a href="#INFILE" TARGET="glosswind">'infile'</a>.  The resulting new 
sound is called the <a href="#OUTFILE" TARGET="glosswind">'outfile'</a>.
	<p>
	<blockquote>
	You may also want to LOAD settings saved during a previous 
	working session.  You could have done this in two different 
	ways:  as a text file or as a (binary) session file.
	<ul>
	<li>If you used SAVE AS TEXT, you need to have a printout or view 
	the file on the screen (in another window) and then use that 
	information to 	re-enter the settings with the graphic sliders 
	etc.

	<li>If you used SAVE SETTINGS, you use <b>Open grnfile</b> on 
	the Toolbar or LOAD SETTINGS in the FILE drop-down menu to load 
	the binary data file for the project.  Select the .grn file you 
	want to use &#150; or select it from the 'most recently used 
	files' portion of the FILE menu.
	</ul>
	<p>
	<b>NB</b> &#150; you could have saved the settings with or 
	without its associated (source) soundfile: 'Associate asoundfile.wav 
	with these settings? Yes&#47;No.'  If <b>with</b>, when 
	you load the .grn file, the soundfile is also loaded.  If 
	<b>without</b>, you must open a soundfile before you will be 
	allowed to load the .grn file.
	</p>
	<p>
	You may have had some single or range parameters in place when 
	you decided to use breakpoint files.  These single or range 
	settings are also saved and reloaded, but are greyed out when 
	the breakpoint files are selected.

<h3 id="PROCESS">Processing a sound with fixed values</h3>

<p>
<IMG SRC="images/gmslider.gif" ALT="[Image of slider bar with Low, Medium 
and High range settings]">
</p>

<p>
Attention focusses on the slider bars.  These are used to select the 
various possible values.  After you open the infile, a large dialogue 
box will appear, filling the screen.  The main menu is still available, 
awaiting, for example, a different <i>infile</i> to be selected without 
quitting the dialog box.
</p>

<p>
The processing options are named on the left, starting with TIMESTRETCH 
at the top of the screen and ending with SPACE at the bottom of the 
screen.  To the right of these process option names are three buttons, 
marked <b>L M H</b> for Low, Medium, and High value spans.  You can 
click on these buttons to set one of three default spans between the 
lowest and highest values which can be used for that processing option.  
</p>

<p>
The <b>High</b> span will display the highest possible value that can be 
given.  The <b>Medium</b> span enables you to use the slider bar to 
select among a span of midrange values.  And the <b>Low</b> span enables 
you to move the slider bar through a span of small values.
</p>

<p>
The value selected in this way is a FIXED value which stays the same as 
the sound is created.

</p>

<h3 id="ACTIVATE">Activating RANGE to use a range of values</h3>

<p>
However, it is possible to make sounds in which these values vary 
randomly within a user-defined RANGE of values.
</p>

<p>
When you click on the box to the right of the word RANGE, a check mark 
appears to show that it is now active &#150; and a second slider bar also 
appears above the original one.  It also has the <b>L M H</b> span 
options.  Now the lower (original) slider bar is used to set the 
<b>lower</b> of the two values in this range, and the upper (new) slider 
bar is used to set the <b>upper</b> of the two values in this range.  
</p>

<p>
You will notice that the program will not let you set a High value 
(upper slider) which is lower than the Low value (lower slider), nor a 
Low value (lower slider) higher than the High value (upper slider).  
The slider just clicks back to the value in the other slider when you 
try to move it to these illogical positions.  You may, however, see 
the sliders positioned 'the other way round' if you  have selected H 
(a high range setting) for the upper slider, and M or L (a Medium or 
Low range setting) for the lower slider.

</p>

<h3 id="TIMEVARY">Time-varying values &amp; BRKEDIT</h3>

<p>
It is also possible to vary most of the the parameter values over time.  
This involves creating a 'breakpoint file' which specifies a time and 
the value for a parameter which is to come into force at that time.
</p>

<p>
This can be done by writing a breakpoint text file with a text editor.  
It normally takes the form of separate lines, each with a <i>time value</i>
pair separated by a space or a tab.  It is unusual for any additional 
text to be allowed, but BRKEDIT does provide an 'extended format' which 
can handle some additional textual information regarding the type of 
line span (logarithmic or exponential).
</p>

<p>
The time-varying section of the <i>GrainMill</i> dialog box is on the 
right hand side of the page.  
<IMG SRC="images/gmbrkctrls.gif" align=right ALT="[Image of the Breakpoint editor controls]">
It initially contains default breakpoint 
files for each parameter.  You can enter or browse for the name of a 
breakpoint text file you have created with a text editor, as above, or

<h2 id="RANGE">Using Range to set a group of changing values</h2>

<p>
The Range option is absolutely essential if good results are to be 
achieved with <i>GrainMill</i>.  When you activate this option by clicking 
on the little box next to the word 'Range', a second slider bar appears 
for that particular processing function.  The lower slider bar is used 
to set a low limit and the upper slider bar is used to set a high limit 
for a range of numbers.  <i>GrainMill</i> then, for each grain, selects 
a value at random from somewhere between these limits.  This grain-by-grain 
randomisation of values adds the essential qualities of variety and 
plasticity to the final result - qualities that make all the difference.

<h2 id="SPLICESLOPES">Shaping grains to avoid clicks</h2>

<p>
Creating sounds with sound-grains raises the question as to how the grains 
are joined together.  You can run <i>GrainMill</i> in such a way that it 
creates audible gaps between grains &shy; a staccatto or hiccuping effect.  
However, if the new sound you make is to have no silent gaps between the 
grains, it seems obvious that the grains must either overlap one another, 
or 'just touch' one another.  In practice, however, the grains must always 
overlap just a little bit, to produce a continuous output sound.  Why is this?
</p>

<p>
It is not possible simply to chop up sound as if with a knife.  If you do 
this, you will produce a click where the cut sound ends, because the 
volume is likely to fall off a cliff, as it were:  from high to nothing 
within an instant.  Among other things, the physical mechanism 
reproducing the sound for our ears cannot cope with such an abrupt change.
To avoid this, we use a tapered cut, called a 'splice slope'.  A splice 
crescendos from silence at the start of the sound (its 
<a href="#ATTACK"><b>'attack'</b></a>), or 
decrescendos into silence at the end of the sound (it's 'decay') &shy; 
though <a href="#BUTT"><b>butt joins</b></a> 
are also possible (no sloping envelope at all).  In this case, the 'sound' 
is a single grain.  However, we usually don't want to hear these little 
crescendos and decresendos in our new sound because of the tremolo effect 
produced by the (very) rapid fall-rise-fall-rise etc. in volume.  It is 
for this reason that the program overlaps the grains a little, so that 
the crescendo on the following grain comes in as the previous grain 
decresendos, thus maintaining a certain consistency of volume.

<h2 id="TIMESTRETCH">Stretching time with <i>GrainMill</i></h2>

<p>
TIMESTRETCH alters the length (duration) of the outfile.
</p>

<p>
When the TIMESTRETCH slider bar is set to a value greater than 1, 
grains which overlap are cut from the <i>infile</i> and then reassembled 
in the <i>outfile</i> in such a way that they do not overlap as much, 
thus stretching out the sound.
</p>

<p>
When the TIMESTRETCH value is 1, there is no change.
</p>

<p>
When the TIMESTRETCH value is less than 1, grains which do not 
overlap are cut from infile (there may even be gaps between these 
grains:  bits of soundfile missed out) and then reassembled in such 
a way that they do overlap, thus shrinking the sound.
</p>

<p>
The upper limit of TIMESTRETCH can be very high and should be 
used with caution.
</p>

<p>
The 'outfile duration' box at the bottom of the dialog box shows 
the effect of changing both TIMESTRETCH and GRAINSIZE.  The duration 
is a maximum estimate, and can be edited if necessary.
</p>

<p>
In fact, the outfile duration box is active &shy; not just reporting 
what the program is doing.
</p>

<h4>A special case</h4>

<p>
For example, it is necessary to provide (i.e., type into the outfile 
duration box) a duration in the special case when TIMESTRETCH is set 
to 0.  With this setting, the initial grainsized segment of infile 
is used over and over, possibly forever - hence the need to specify 
a length for the outfile.  In this special case, the infile is being 
used simply as the source of a waveform of some kind:  the source 
from which the grain is to be extracted.  In the simplest case, this 
infile need be scarcely any  longer than the required grainsize.
</p>

<p>
The simplest grain waveform is a sinewave of arbitrary pitch.  
However, any input sound can be used, including Frequency 
Modulated (FM) waves, and chirp waves (a sine wave of rapidly 
increasing pitch), as well as acoustically sampled waveforms.

<h2 id="DENSITY">Altering the density of the sound texture</h2>

<p>
When DENSITY is 1, the grains are placed end to end 
(a <a href="#BUTT"><b>butt edit</b></a>) 
and the original sound pulsates slightly at a speed related to the grainsize.
</p>

<p>
As DENSITY becomes increasingly greater than 1 (more dense), the 
grains overlap more and more, producing a continuous to smooth/dense 
sound.  For example, when DENSITY is set to 5, there will be 5 
grains in the <i>outfile</i> where there was 1 grain in the <i>infile</i>, 
i.e., 5 grains overlapped where previously there was only 1 grain.  When 
one or more of the RANGE options are activated, each of these 5 grains 
will be separately processed.  This is how the <i>outfile</i> becomes more 
and more complex.  Densities of 50, 100, or even 200 simply make the 
outfile texture more and more complex &shy; depending on the other 
settings.  The upper limit in this program is 256.
</p>

<p>
As DENSITY becomes increasingly less than 1 (less dense), we begin 
to hear silences between the grains.  If the grains are very short, 
and the density is only just below 1, this will appear as a kind 
of grittiness in the new sound.  But if the density is nearer 
to 0, the new sound will appear as a stream of tiny, separate 
<a href="#ATTACK"><b>attacks</b></a> or grains.

<h2 id="GRAINSIZE">Adjusting the size of the grains</h2>

<p>
The size (i.e., duration) of each grain has a major effect on the 
result.  In the first place, the fact that each <a href="#GRAIN"><b>grain</b></a> of sound has splice slopes sets some limits 
which cannot be over-stepped.  The fact that we need two of these splices 
for every grain (one ascending from silence and one descending to silence) 
limits the size of the grains we can use:  the smallest grain cannot 
be shorter than the two splices &shy; don't worry, the program makes 
this impossible.  The smallest grain allowed by the program is currently 
12.5 <a href="#MILLISECONDS"><b>milliseconds</b></a> 
(0.0125 sec), and this provides the space needed for the splice slopes at 
the beginning and end of each grain.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, if the grains are very, very, very short, they will 
contain so little information from the original sound that its 
qualities will be destroyed.  So there is a lower limit on the size 
of the grains.  If your grains are about 50 milliseconds in length 
(0.05 of a second), they will happily capture the qualities of your sound.
</p>

<p>
Once the grains become much longer than this, we create a different 
effect.  Almost every natural sound changes through time:  it changes 
pitch, loudness, and its sound-colourSound_colour.  If you are 
using grains to timestretch a sound to double its length, the 
grains you cut from the original sound will use overlapped portions 
of the original sound.  In fact, each grain will contain a copy of 
half the previous grain.
</p>

<p>
If the original sound is itself changing, and your grain is 
sufficiently long, the sound inside the grain will itself be changing.  
When you now place the next grain after the first, you will hear 
that change in the sound being repeated .. the output sound will 
seem to backtrack to a place earlier in the change-process.  There 
will be a kind of very fast echo inside the sound.
</p>

<p>
These 'internal echoes' may be a very interesting effect if this is 
what you want to hear.  However, if you just want to make your 
original sound longer, you need to avoid this internal echoing.  It 
turns out that a grainsize of around 50 milliseconds (0.05 sec) 
captures enough of your sound to retain its special sound quality, 
but not so much of it that you are able to hear any change in the 
sound within the grain.  Using grains of about 50 ms allows the 
sound to be stretched without any sense of internal echoes.
</p>

<p>
Grainsizes longer than 50 ms allow more of the original sound to 
come through.  A sandy beach reveals very little of the shape and 
quality of the original stones from which the sand was ground, but 
shingle is much closer to the original shape and texture of the 
rock from which it was formed.  Note that there is a relationship 
between the type of input sound and the effect a given grainsize 
will have.  The sharper (faster) the attack transient in the infile, 
the more it will be present in the grain, even with a fairly short 
grainsize, and certainly with a grainsize as long as or longer than 
this attack transient.
</p>

<h3>
Using a range of grainsizes
</h3>

<p>
The <a href="#RANGE">RANGE</a> option enables you to set a range 
of grainsizes.  When activated by clicking on the box next to the 
word RANGE, a second slider appears.  The lower slider is used to 
set the low limit of the range, and the upper slider is used to set 
the high limit of the range.  Now the program will pick out grainsizes 
at random between these two ranges, a different grainsize for each grain.  
Introducing this random suppleness into the texture improves the 
result considerably: &nbsp; it is more lively and feels more natural.
</p>

<p>
A very good range to choose is between 50 ms and 80 ms.  Ranges 
greater than 100 ms (0.01 sec) will begin to produce collage-type 
textures, i.e., sounds in which portions of the infile are distinctly 
recognisable.
</p>

<h3>
On internal echoes
</h3>

<p>
Echoes inside the new sound can be useful.  Room reverberation is 
produced when the sound waves from some event in a room bounce back 
off walls, floors, ceilings and other surfaces, producing a multitude 
of slightly different copies of the original sound - each arriving 
at our ears at a slightly different time.  There are so many of 
these different echoes that we hear them not as true echoes, but 
as reverberation, which enlivens and enriches the original sound.
</p>

<p>
If you:
<ul>
<li>choose grains not quite in exact sequence (by using WANDER), and 
<li>place them in slightly randomised positions in the output sound 
(by using SPACE), and even 
<li>use a slight microtonal variation of pitch (by using PITCH), and 
<li>make small variations in loudness (by using LOUDNESSS), and then 
<li>create a higher density (by using DENSITY) 
</ul>
... then you will produce an effect like the reverberation of a room.
</p>

<p>
Once your grains start to become any larger than 50 ms (0.05 sec), 
you will generate obvious echoes inside your reconstructed sound.  
If your grains are 'very' long (e.g., 1 second) and if you use the 
WANDER process over a very large span, you will produce a kind of 
random collage of pieces of your original sound.

<h2 id="WANDER">Wandering grain locations</h2>

<p>
WANDER defines a length of soundfile within which the next 
grain is to be selected at random.  The longer the length, the more 
likely it is that the new grain will come from a location ever more 
further away from the previous grain.  This length is sometimes called 
a 'searchfield', i.e., the span of sound to search when selecting a grain.  
A small searchfield to 'wander' about in will result in a somewhat 
blurred image, whereas a large searchfield will result in scrambling 
the original sound.
</p>

<p>
With WANDER set to 0, grains are selected from <i>infile</i> in the 
strict order in which they were cut in the first place.With WANDER set 
to (say) 0.1 sec (100 ms), a grain is chosen from <i>infile</i> within 
a range of 0.1 seconds before the 'true' position.  In other words, there 
is a certain vagueness about the order of the grains chosen for use in 
your new sound.  The larger the WANDER, the more vagueness there is!
</p>

<p>
And if you set WANDER to cover the entire length of the original 
sound, then the vagueness will be complete:  your original sound will 
become completely scrambled.  It is useful to know that the 
searchfield gradually expands when it is set to the length of the 
entire soundfile.  <i>GrainMill</i> reads through the infile, and as 
it does so its 'here' position is moving through the file.  The 
searchfield is from the beginning of the file to 'here' and thus gradually 
gets larger and larger.  This means that the scrambling effect will be 
somewhat minimal at the start and then increase steadily.  This 
transitional process from smooth to chaotic can be useful musically.

<h2 id="PITCH">Moving the pitch of grains up or down</h2>

<p>
Each individual grain can be altered in pitch.  When you set PITCH to 
a (fixed) position along the pitch span slider bar, all the grains are 
transposed by this amount.
</p>

<p>
The span of pitch change values is roughly based on 12, so that each 
integer change represents a transposition of more or less 1 semitone.
</p>

<p>
Values less than zero (i.e., negative values, such as -0.5) 
transpose the grains downwards in pitch.  Remember to precede the 
number with a minus sign!
</p>

<p>
Note that altering the pitch also alters the length of the grains 
(higher pitch shortens grains, lower pitch lengthens grains.  
However, if you set TIMESTRETCH to 1, the duration of the <i>outfile</i> 
will remain the same as the <i>infile</i>, because of the way the grains are 
reassembled.
</p>

<p>
When you activate the RANGE button, a second slider appears and you can 
set lower and upper limits to a range of transposition values.  The 
program will then, for each grain, select a transposition value at 
random from somewhere within this range.  The sonic results of these 
random jumps of pitch can vary remarkably as the size of the range is 
increased.
</p>

<p>
Normally, an especially fast method is used to transpose a grain.  
If a large value is used, especially for downwards transposition, 
this can lead to unwanted grittiness or distortion.  This can be 
prevented by clicking on the 'HiFi Transpose' button, which tells 
<i>GrainMill</i> to use a slower but much more accurate method..

<h2 id="LOUDNESS">Controlling the loudness of the grains</h2>

<p>
Each individual grain can be altered in loudness (also known as 
'amplitude').  When you set LOUDNESS to a (fixed) position along the 
loudness span slider, all the grains become correspondingly louder or 
softer.  The LOUDNESS span represents <a href="#DECIBELS"><b>decibels</b></a> (dB) and extends from silence (-60dB) 
to full (original) volume (0 dB).  The action of the tapering grains 
and <a href="#SPLICESLOPES">splice slopes</a> of each grain will have 
a volume-reducing effect, but the program does its best to minimise this 
and prevent the sound from becoming too soft.
</p>

<p>
<i>GrainMill</i> uses a default splice slope of 5 milliseconds.  This 
gives a fairly sharp attack (and decay) for each grain.  If you want to 
soften this attack, you can select one of the other splice slope options 
provided.  Long grains with long (gradual) slopes makes sense, but 
putting a long slope on a very short grain will either not be allowed or 
may reduce the output volume by an unacceptable amount.
</p>

<p>
When you activate the RANGE button, a second slider appears and you can 
set lower and upper limits to a range of loudness values.  The program 
will then, for each grain, select a decibel level at random from somewhere 
within this range.  Having a range of random loudness values in the 
texture adds a great deal to the character of a granular sound.

natural feel in the flow of the grains.  If it is set to zero, pitch 
artefacts may result from the regular timing of the grains.  Trying it 
both with and without SCATTER may be necessary to determine what best 
suits the sound and the context.  The control comes up with a default

Here we are processing the movement of sound through space:  to be 
more precise, the Left &lt;&shy;&nbsp;&nbsp;&shy;&gt; Right movement of 
a stereo image across a horizontal plane, known as 
<a href="#LOCATION"><b>'panning'</b></a>.  
The SPACE process re-positions each grain in the horizontal stereo field.  
</p>

<p>
If the input is <a href="#MONO"><b>mono</b></a> 
(one channel), the program will automatically produce (the necessary) 
stereo output when SPACE is used.  The setting on the SPACE slider bar 
selects a fixed position in the Left-Right stereo field.
</p>

<p>
When RANGE is activated, a second slider bar appears and a specific 
range can be selected, usually using the lower bar for the Left limit, 
and the upper bar for the Right limit.
</p>

<p>
Full Left on the lower slider bar + full Right on the upper slider 
bar sets the full stereo field as the range within which each 
grain is randomly positioned.  This can be tightened by moving the 
sliders more to the middle.
</p>

<p>
Sounds panned between full Left on the lower slider bar and 
Centre on the upper slider bar means that only the left side of 
the field will be used.
</p>

<p>
Sounds panned between Centre on the lower slider bar and full 
Right on the upper slider bar means that only the Right side of 
the field will be used.
</p>

<p>
If both sliders are set to Centre (the <a href="#DEFAULTS"><b>defaults</b></a>), the program will produce a mono <i>outfile</i> (making it pointless to use the RANGE option).  Note that any non-zero SPACE value will cause the program to produce a 
stereo <i>outfile</i>.  However, the sound can be located on only 
one channel of this stereo soundfile if either:
<blockquote>
a single (fixed) value to the Left or Right of Centre is used,<br>
OR
<br>
both sliders are close to the Left or Right.<br>
</blockquote>

It is the distance between the sliders that sets the stereo spread

<h3 id="GRAIN">What is a 'grain' of sound?</h3>

<p>
A 'grain' is a tiny bit of something - in this case sound rather than 
e.g., sand or corn.  A sound made up of lots of small 'grains' usually has 
a somewhat rough texture.  It can sound just a bit rough-textured or bumpy, 
or may sound fiercely repetitive.  It all depends.  Similar to the paintings 
of Seurat who used tiny dots of paint rather than the usual brush stroke, 
the sound is made up of lots and lots of tiny pieces.  A sound made up of 
grains is described as 'granular', and creating sounds like this is called 
'granular synthesis'.'

<h3 id="DECIBELS">Decibels: a measure of loudness</h3>

<p>
The scale of loudness calculated in decibels (abbreviated as dB) is a 
logarithmic scale.  The logarithmic scale is used for decibels because this 
is how the ear works.  What this means is simply that equal divisions of 
the scale will sound to us as equally louder or softer, whereas 
mathematically the values are actually doubling.  Logarithms are a way of 
linking linear and geometric values (such as 1, 2, 3,4 and 2 4 8, 16):  
a single (i.e., equally spaced) step in the linear scale involves a 
doubling of the previous value in the geometric scale.  If the loudness 
scale were to be represented on the screen as a linear scale (and the 
same is true of pitch), most of the changes that we can perceive with 
our ears would be bunched together at one end of the scale.  Textbooks 
on acoustics provide a full mathematical explanation of these matters, 
and often include a chart illustrating where familiar sounds normally 
come on the scale of decibels.

<h3 id="TIMBRE">Sound-colour: a description of tone quality</h3>

<p> 
The 'colour' of a sound is more technically known as its 'timbre'.  This 
means how many and which frequencies are present as the sound flows through 
time.  This frequency content is constantly changing, in some sounds more 
than in others.  For example, a flute has a clear luminous tone, while 
an oboe has a considerably more complex sound, and a train engine 
has a very rich sound indeed!  We have adopted the word 'colour' from 
painters to describe these differences;  they all come down to the 
ever-changing frequency content of a sound.

<h3 id="BUTT">Splices: Butt and sloping joins</h3>

<p>
In the 'classical tape studio', analog tape was spliced by cutting off 
selected pieces with a razor blade and then joining up the pieces with 
a special white splicing tape.  These cuts were usually made with the 
help of a splicing block, and there was a groove at 45&#37; for a 'smooth' 
join (the two pieces of tape would overlap) and a vertical groove for 
what was called a butt edit (no overlap at all).  Similarly, in 
<i>GrainMill</i>, the grains are 'abutted' when there is no overlap.  
However, note that there is in this case still the tapering of the sound 
from and to zero volume, with which each grain is shaped in order to avoid 
clicks.

<h3 id="LOCATION">Panning a sound</h3>

<p>
The terminology 'to pan a sound', 'panning a sound', or just 'panning', 
refers to the psycho-acoustic effect whereby sound appears to move 
through space.  To illustrate:  a (stereo) sound can 'move' from left 
to right.  In this case, the stereo image is actually coming out of both 
speakers, but the right hand speaker starts with zero volume and the 
left hand speaker with full volume.  Then the right hand speaker gets 
progressively louder as the left hand speaker gets progressively quieter.  
To the ear of the listener (positioned centrally in front of both speakers), 
the sound appears to move from left to right.

<h3 id="MONO">Mono Soundfile</h3>

<p>
A mono soundfile has only 1 channel.  If there are two loudspeakers, 
the(same)  sound signal is output by both of them.

<h3 id="DEFAULTS">Defaults</h3>

<p>
Programs frequently use 'defaults'.  A Default is a pre-set value, 
particularly for frequently used settings.  It can usually be changed 
by the user, but it can be convenient to have it there automatically to 
start with.  It saves having to set every single value that is needed.

<h3 id="ATTACK">Attack - Sustain - Decay</h3>

<p>
These terms refer to the loudness shape (amplitude 'envelope') of the 
sound. They describe some of the most noticeable and important features 
of a sound.  The attack transient is how the sound begins, in particular 
how quickly the loudness increases;  the Sustain portion refers to the 
loudness characteristics of the main part of the sound  the Decay portion 
is how it ends, for example whether it stops abruptly or gradually trails 
off into silence.
