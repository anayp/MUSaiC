MINSIL   Dur (mS) of min silence between events (Range 2000/srate to 10000).
PREGAIN  Gain of input signal (Range >0 to 1).

EVENING  Range 0 - 1.
    With METER 0: the events are evened-out in level by "EVENING".
    0 has no effect, while 1 tries to make event-levels equal.
    Intermediate values produce more or less evening-out of levels.
    With nonzero METER e.g. 3,
    unaccented beats take level relative specified in "EVENING".
    e.g. Evening = 0.3 sets unaccented beats to 1/3 level of accented.

=================================================================================================
AE:
---


1  Specify the times of peaks in the input. Output these at a regular pulse in the given tempo
2  Synchronise specified peaks to specified times at a specified tempo (Also see Mode 2 below. This mode is not available on the Command Line. It is available in Sound Loom.)
3  Shorten existing events in the input sound. This process shortens the events in the infile. It assumes these events are separated by silences, however short.
4  Find existing events in the input sound and output them at a regular tempo (MM). This process assumes that these events are separated by silences, however short.
5  Find events in the input sound and change their speed by a factor. This process assumes these events are separated by silences, however short.
6  Position events in the input sound at specified beats in the output. This process assumes these events are separated by silences, however short.
7  Position events in the input sound at specified times in the output. This process assumes these events are separated by silences, however short.
8  Specify an event within the input sound and repeat it at a specified tempo. This process assumes these events are separated by silences, however short.
9  Replace some events in the input sound by silence, using a specified pattern of 'deletions'. This process can be used to change the rhythmic pattern of the input events. It assumes these events are separated by silences, however short.
10  Adjust the levels of events in the input sound, changing the pattern of accents. This process can be used to change the accenting pattern of the input events. It assumes these events are separated by silences, however short.
11  Finds durations of shortest and longest events in the input sound (not silences). This process assumes these events are separated by silences, however short. Output is to the Console.
12  Find the start of the sound in the file (the 1st non-zero sample). The starttime of the event is written to a new, or an existing datafile. The latter allows several sounds to be run through the process to the same datafile, accumulating a list of the starttimes of each sound processed. – On the Sound Loom a list of sounds on the Chosen Files can be processed via the Bulk Process mechanism, to produce a single output datafile.
13  Find the peak in the input sound and move all the data so the peak is at a specified time. This process allows the peak within a soundfile to be placed at a specific time after the file start. To achieve this, the entire sound is moved by inserting or removing silence.
14  Specify an event in the input sound and move all the data so the event is at a specified time. This process allows the event you specify within the input soundfile to be placed at a specific time after the file start. To achieve this, the entire sound is moved by inserting or removing silence.
