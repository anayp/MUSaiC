<h3>
<a name = "SDBATSINTRO">Introduction</a> to the Sound Builder Templates</a>
</h3>

	<p>
	There are three versions of each template.
		<ol>	
		<li>The ones with 'mp3' in the name is for download and 
		demonstration purposes:  the mp3 versions of the 
		soundfiles save space, and you can play the examples 
		right away from the HTML document.</li>
		<li>The ones with 'wav' in the name are for your use 
		after running the batch files:  wav files are produced 
		and you can play back <i>your</i> results from the HTML 
		document.  The files with 'del' in the name enable to 
		delete the files made in a given example (but not the 
		sources), so that you can easily run it again.</li>
		<li>The ones with 'mac' in the name are for your use 
		after running the batch files when you are using the 
		.aiff sources and the MAC batch files.  (If you are 
		on MAC and using the .wav sources, you should use 
		the files with 'wav' in the name.)
		</ol>
	</p>

	<p>
	One of the keys to success with the CDP sound transformation 
	software is creating processing 'chains': i.e., where the output 
	of one process becomes the input of another.  This is how a 
	sound or sonic texture is gradually sculpted into something 
	that is original and vivid.
	</p>

	<p>
	The <b>Sound-Builder Templates</b> illustrate a handful of 
	possibilities that can easily be explored by running the supplied 
	batch files (PC and MAC versions).  Simply by editing the batch 
	file so that a different sound becomes the source, the whole 
	process is then automatically run, producing a result that is 
	similar, but not the same:  because the source is different.
	</p>

	<p>
	The source files supplied with this processing-sequence demo 
	are in <b>.wav</b> format, but the intermediate and final 
	result soundfiles are supplied in <b>.mp3</b> format in order 
	to save space.  Intermediate analysis files have been converted 
	to the Time Domain and to <b>.mp3</b> for playback of the 
	examples as supplied.
	</p>

	<p>
	Should you run the batch files, either with the same source or with a 
	different soundfile as source, <b>.wav</b> soundfiles and <b>.ana</b> 
	analysis files will be produced.  Batchfiles with 'del' in the name 
	are supplied so that you can quickly clear away the files produced 
	by running one of the processing-sequence batch files.  For example, 
	the deletions file for RE-ENTRY is <i>reentdel.bat</i>.
	</p>

	<p>
	Please note that this use of batch files from the command line 
	interpreter (MSDOS on PC, the Terminal on MAC) is a direct but 
	low-level way to run processing sequences.  Higher level methods 
	are available in <i>Soundshaper</i> (sequences are built up 
	automatically on its patch grid) and in <i>Sound Loom</i> 
	(the sequences are called 'Instruments').  These all form ways 
	of creating 'libraries' of your favourite and most effective 
	processes.
	</p>

<h2 id="SOUNDSHAPER">APPENDIX: SCREENSHOT UPDATES</h2>

<p>
The Soundshaper screenshots used in the tutorials are unfortunately out of date. This is not a great problem, as the only ones that are affected are:

<ul>
<li><b>Screenshots of Parameter Pages showing boxes to name output files, for example:</b><br>
	<br> 
	<div style="text-align: left;"><img style="width: 282px;
                height: 150px;" alt="I/O Dialog"
                src="images/cer3b.gif">
        </div><br>

Output files are no longer named on Parameter Pages: instead, the output is saved to a temporary file and appears on the Main Page patchgrid in a new cell named after the process (see, for example, "REVERSE" in the next screenshot). <br><br>
If you want to save the output permanently, highlight the cell (if necessary) and click <b>File/Save</b> or <b>CTRL+S</b> to obtain a standard SAVE dialog:
	<br><br>
	<div style="text-align: left;"><img style="width: 500px;
                height: 285px;" alt="Save File"
                src="images/save1.jpg">
        </div>
	<br>
There is normally no need to do this until the end of the sequence.</li><br>

<li><b>FFT conversion (PVOC Analysis / Resynthesis) page, for example:</b><br>
	<br> 
	<div style="text-align: left;"><img style="width: 432px;
                height: 294px;" alt="FFT Dialog"
                src="images/analyse1.gif">
        </div><br>
Soundshaper now uses current settings and the FFT page is only used to set these, not to perform a conversion, as shown. As the tutorial examples use default values, there is nothing to set! 
Furthermore, Soundshaper does these conversions in the background, so you do not even have to select ANALYSE or SYNTH &#150; just select the next process.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<b>Each tutorial has an updated list of steps at the end, for running the CDP sequence in the current version of Soundshaper.</b>
</p>
