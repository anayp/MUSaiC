<h3>Key Features of the CDP TEXTURE set</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>TEXTURE creates multi-event textures by repeating the 
	input soundfile at specified times and pitches, along with 
	many other ways to shape the result.</li>
	<li>TEXTURE can select pitches at random within specified 
	limits, OR 'snap' them to user-defined harmonic grids.</li>
	<li>TEXTURE can make use of rhythmic motifs and melodic 
	figures with user-defined pitch, amplitude, duration and onset 
	times.</li>
	<li>Most parameters, including the harmonic grids, can 
	change over time.</li>
	</ul>

<h3>A variety of musical results possible with TEXTURE</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>textural gestures with time-shaped edges and density 
	control, with pitches chosen at random from a pitch range 
	or snapped to a harmonic grid (see our soundbyte below)</li>
	<li>groups of textural gestures (as in the previous type) 
	spaced in a fixed or time-varying way
	<li>figures or groups of defined melodic&#47;rhythmic figures 
	which begin at times predefined by a timing grid 
	<li>a repeating rhythm articulated with notes chosen at 
	random or from a defined harmonic grid
	<li>a melodic line in which each note is textured with 
	overlapping note-events
	<li>a melodic line with one or more fully defined musical 
	figures attached to its various notes, motifs chosen from 
	a random pitch range or from a harmonic grid
	<li>fully defined musical figures attached to a random 
	pitch range or a harmonic grid, <i>without</i> an underlying 
	melodic line
	<li>figures whose pitch-relationships are warped in the 
	process of making all their pitches fit a predefined 
	harmonic grid
	<li>canonic processes made from the repetitions of 
	extended melodic phrases.
	</ul>

<h3>Other forms of texturing in CDP</h3>
	<ul>
	<li><b><i>GrainMill</i></b> &#150; Similar results can be 
	achieved with <i>GrainMill</i>, but there are various important 
	differences.  The first of these is that TEXTURE plays its 
	input file from its beginning at the onset of every note 
	event, then playing either all or part of it as instructed 
	by the user.   <i>GrainMill</i> on the other hand 'granularises' 
	the input, turning it into grains as it gradually moves through the 
	input soundfile from start to finish.  Thus, for example, a 
	timestretched sound with significant timbral changes (such as 
	a morphed sound) will make these changes audible in a slow-motion 
	granularised texture.  Other differences are that TEXTURE 
	is able to lock the events onto harmonic grids (as in our example), 
	play with defined melodic and rhythmic motifs, and accept 
	multiple soundfile inputs.</li>
	<li>In the wavecycle DISTORTION set, note that DISTORT REPEAT both 
	extends and textures the original source sound.
	<li>The whole GRAIN set as well as forms of EXTENSION such as 
	EXTEND LOOP and EXTEND DRUNK (see 'Segmentation') also texture 
	the input sound.</li>
	<li>One more example to mention here is time-varying vibrato 
	applied to the input sound (as analysis data).</li>
	</ul>

<h3>General observations</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>My view as a composer is that the TEXTURE program suite 
	occupies <b>important middle ground</b> between creating sounds 
	and creating scores.  Furthermore, it does so in a semi-algorithmic 
	way, so that a whole spectrum of possibilities from the very random 
	to the completely defined is available.  I say 'semi-algorithmic' 
	because it doesn't use a scripting language.  However, the presence 
	of a note data file, parameter ranges and comprehensive breakpoint 
	file options provide tremendous tools with which to shape the 
	algorithms the programs use to create the note-event-based sound 
	textures.
	<li>The 'use whole duration of input sound' option is very 
	important, opening up the possibility of cumulative sonic 
	effects which are greater than the 'sum of the parts' as it were.  
	Pre-processing the input sound with a given cumulative sonic 
	effect in mind is the key.  For example, imagine preparing a 
	sound which is a long strand with a gradually increasing amount 
	of vibrato and a pitch which wavers slightly in a time-varying 
	way.  Now imagine creating a texture with this input, using the 
	whole duration, in which these strands are gradually packed more 
	densely in pitch and onset time.  The mixing of all these 
	strands will potentially become a seething, turbulent flow ...
	</ul>
