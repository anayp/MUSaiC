SEGMENTATION: Detailed Information
</h1>

<blockquote>
<h3>Key Features of the CDP SEGMENTATION programs</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>multiple time-varying parameters</li>
	<li>spectral options to play with the order of analysis window</li>
	<li>the shuffle options provide original and powerful ways 
	to create patterns in the segments</li>
	<li>the texture set is one of the most extensive and powerful 
	sets in the CDP catalogue</li>
	<li>repetition and shuffling are also available in the 
	wavecycle distortion set</li>
	</ul>

<h3>Some possible musical results with EXTEND</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>Segmentation of vocal sounds can create disjointed and 
	humorous effects.</li>
	<li>Staccato or flowing, reverberant effects can be achieved.</li>
	<li>Surface texture can be made rough or smooth.</li>
	<li>The source can be slightly broken up, made completely 
	unrecognisable, or anything inbetween.</li>
	</ul>

<h3>Other forms of segmentation in CDP</h3>
CDP has a very large array of programs with which to segment 
sounds and manipulate the segments.  They include:
	<ul>
	<li>BRASSAGE &#150; comprehensive granulation facilities</li>
	<li>GRAINMILL &#150; graphic version of BRASSAGE with 
	built-in breakpoint editor</li>
	<li>TEXTURE &#150; build complex textures of many kinds</li>
	<li>EXTEND LOOP	&#150; move through a soundfile, with 
	discrete or overlapping segments</li>
	<li>EXTEND SCRAMBLE &#150; randomised segmentation</li>
	<li>EXTEND ZIGZAG &#150; move through soundfile both forwards 
	and backwards</li>
	<li>BLUR DRUNK &#150; drunken walk through analysis windows</li>
	<li>BLUR SHUFFLE &#150; set the order and number of repetitions 
	of analysis windows</li>
	<li>DISTORT SHUFFLE &#150; set the order and number of repetitions 
	of wavecycles</li>
	<li>BLUR WEAVE &#150; define a path forwards and backwards 
	through analysis windows</li>
	<li>GRAIN &#150; additional grain manipulation functions, 
	such as reorder, create rhythms, transpose, reposition 
	where grains are taken from the source.</li>
	</ul>

<h3>General observations</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>Extending sonic material is a basic task in compositional 
	work.</li>
	<li>When composing with sounds, recognisability and 
	qualitative differences in surface texture are important tools.</li>
	<li>Programs such as EXTEND DRUNK, GRAINMILL (BRASSAGE) and 
	TEXTURE have multiple (time-varying) parameters which offer a 
	huge range of possibilities.</li>
	<li>The variety of CDP's segmentation programs provide many 
	different ways to approach extending material in this way.</li>
	</ul>
