ENVELOPING: Detailed Information
</h1>

  <blockquote>
<h3>Key Features of the CDP ENVELOPING Functions</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>Amplitude envelope extraction can be done all at once, 
	or extracting and imposing the envelope can be done in 
	separate operations.  The advantage of the latter is that 
	an envelope file is created which can then be applied to 
	different sounds.</li><br>
	<br>
	<li>FORMANTS VOCODE operates in the spectral domain and 
	concerns the spectral envelope, the ever-changing pattern 
	of frequency content in the sound.</li><br>
	<br>
	<li>It is also possible to work with the resonant frequencies 
	of a sound, i.e., its formants.  FORMANTS GET and FORMANTS PUT 
	similarly extract and impose this kind of data between sounds.</li><br>
	<br>
	<li>Envelopes can be shaped by hand, as it were, by creating 
	envelope breakpoint files, either with a text editor or with one 
	of the graphic breakpoint editors available in the CDP 
	software.</li><br>
	<br>
	<li>There are many other ways to shape envelopes with CDP 
	software, such as emphasising the attack, creating a plucked 
	effect, dovetailing the start and end of a sound, normalising, 
	time-reverse, exaggeration, attenuation, raising, time-stretching, 
	flattening or gating the envelope.
	</li>
	</ul>

<h3>Some possible musical results with ENVEL</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>Ebb and flow of a sound by splicing (or mixing with overlap) 
	forwards and reversed versions of a fairly steady-state sound, then 
	a DOVETAIL with linear shape to&#47;from the centre point of the 
	whole sound: thus it gradually rises from and returns to 
	silence.</li><br>
	<br>
	<li>Reshaping the existing amplitude contour with a specially 
	designed breakpoint file (ENVEL REPLACE, Mode 3), or with one 
	of the 15 different processes available in ENVEL REPLOT (input 
	is a breakpoint file), ENVEL RESHAPE (input is a binary envelope 
	file), or ENVEL WARP (input is a soundfile): Normalise, Time reverse, 
	Exaggerate, Attenuate, Lift, Time-stretch, Flatten, Gate, Invert, 
	Limit, Corrugate, Expand, Trigger bursts, Move to ceiling or Duck.
	</li><br>
	<br>
	<li>Introduce amplitude tremolo (ENVEL TREMOLO).</li><br>
	<br>
	<li>Emphasise the beginning of the sound (ENVEL ATTACK and ENVEL 
	PLUCK).</li><br>
	<br>
	<li>Transfer the amplitude or spectral envelope from another 
	sound, as illustrated by these examples.</li>
	</ul>

<h3>Other forms of enveloping in CDP</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>All breakpoint files create time-varying contours which in 
	effect envelope that particular parameter, such as upper and 
	lower pitch contours in a texture.</li><br>
	<br>
	<li>Pitch shapes can be extracted from several sounds 
	and then combined in different ways as transposition files, 
	thus imposing shapes from one sound onto another.</li><br>
	<br>
	<li>Any text breakpoint file can be converted to an amplitude 
	envelope file with ENVEL BRKTOENV.  Thus, for example, you 
	could extract a pitch contour, saving as a breakpoint file, 
	convert it to a binary envelope file and impose it on a different 
	sound.</li><br>
	<br>
	<li>DISTORT ENVEL and DISTORT REFORM modify the existing 
	wavecycle envelope shape with some other envelope shape.</li><br>
	<br>
	<li>STRANGE WAVE oscillates between harmonic and inharmonic 
	states, which results in a kind of vibrato.</li><br>
	<br>
	<li>ENVEL TREMOLO produces an amplitude tremolo.</li>
	</ul>

<h3>General observations</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>Enveloping is one of the most common and important shaping 
	processes in sound design.</li><br>
	<br>
	<li>Envelope shapes are easily perceptible and form musical 
	gestures which grab the attention and define the character of 
	the music.</li><br>
	<br>
	<li>Envelope shapes are also used to build relationships between 
	sounds, which serves to create an organic wholeness to the 
	music.  This can be done with amplitude envelopes, spectral 
	envelopes (i.e., formant shapes: cross-synthesis) or across 
	different parameters.</li>
	</ul>
