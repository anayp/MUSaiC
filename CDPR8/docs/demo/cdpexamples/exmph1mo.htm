MORPH: Detailed Information
</h1>

<h2 align=center>by Archer Endrich</h2>

<blockquote>
<h3>Key Features of the CDP MORPH set</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>The morphing is achieved by the interpolation of spectral 
	data (frequency content) over time.</li>
	<li>CDP's MORPH deals with the whole spectrum at once.  Other 
	morphing software, such as SNDAN, takes more account of 
	individual partials and might be more effective with pitched 
	sounds.</li>
	<li>Frequency and amplitude start points can be set 
	independently.</li>
	<li>MORPH MORPH contains a <i>stagger</i> parameter by which 
	the start of the 2<sup><small>nd</small></sup> file can be 
	offset.  This makes it possible to customise the location 
	of the morph region.</li>
	</ul>

<h3>Some possible musical results with the CDP MORPH programs</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>Trevor Wishart initiated CDP's morphing software 
	&#150; and the whole of the spectral domain program set &#150; 
	when he sought to duplicate the famous human voices into bees 
	morph which began his composition, <i>Red Bird</i>.  This 
	passage of just a few seconds took two weeks to complete in 
	the 'classical' tape deck studio.  <i>Red Bird</i> is 
	filled with all kinds of sonic transitions and a classic work 
	in the genre.  His initial spectral programming was done at 
	IRCAM, with the assistance of programmers there.</li>
	<li>The morphing process is easiest to implement when the two 
	input sounds are similar and at about the same pitch level.</li>
	<li>Time-varying pitch transposition can help to provide some 
	middle ground between sounds at distinctly different pitch 
	levels, which is often the case with voices.  But due regard 
	must be made for the ease with which the ear perceives vocal 
	changes to be unnatural or weird.</li>
	<li><i>Sufficient time</i> must be allowed for the ear to observe 
	the transition.  Sometimes time-stretching can help to provide 
	the time needed.  A time-varying stretch factor makes it possible 
	to keep the first part of the sound as is (<i>stretch</i>=1) while 
	stretching out the remainder.</li>
	<li>The MORPH BRIDGE and MORPH GLIDE functions can make very 
	dramatic continuous transitions when the spectral content of 
	the two windows selected is strongly dissimilar.</li>
	</ul>

<h3>Other forms of morphing in CDP (transitions and reshaping one 
sound with the characteristics of another)</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>The GLIDE function enables gradual transition between 
	the spectral contents of any two single analysis windows in 
	the input analysis file.</li>
	<li>The BRIDGE function does the same, but using single 
	analysis windows drawn from two different analysis files.</li>
	<li>CDP's broad range of sound transformation functions make it 
	possible to prepare sounds for morphing.  This makes assists in  
	achieving difficult morphs (overcome differences in the sounds) 
	and to fine-tune the psycho-acoustic perception of the morph 
	itself.</li>
	<li>FORMANTS VOCODE transfers the <i>spectral envelope</i> 
	of the second file onto the first (='cross-synthesis').  This 
	works best when the spectral envelope has a lively profile.  
	This profile, based on the amplitude level of the frequency 
	content, has the effect of reshaping the first sound with the 
	timbral characteristics of the second.</li>
	<li>COMBINE CROSS makes a gradual transition from the amplitude 
	of the first spectral envelope to that of the second.  It does 
	this by making a weighted not a full substitution, so it is 
	not as thorough a process as a morph.  However, it can be 
	a useful first step in moving between significantly different 
	timbral characteristics, thus preparing the two sounds for a 
	full morph. </li>
	<li>Combinations which involve transposing the extracted pitch 
	trace of one sound with that of another provide a different 
	approach to sonic reshaping.  For example, if a wide pitch 
	trace is transposed by the ratios of a narrow one, the first 
	sound then seems as if it is being squeezed through a narrow 
	hole.  See REPITCH COMBINE.</li>
	</ul>

<h3>General observations</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>Morphing with sounds generally takes longer than morphing 
	with visual images.  The ear is acutely sensitive to the 
	minutest change and is not easily fooled.</li>
	<li>When there are significant amplitude envelope differences 
	between the sounds (e.g., the second one is rhythmic), one 
	technique is to impose the amplitude envelope of the second 
	sound on at least a part of the first before morphing 
	(ENVELOPE REPLACE).  Blurring might also be used to minimise 
	various peaks in one or both sounds.</li>
	<li>A smooth morph may not sound any different from a 
	cross-fade.  There are times when one wants to <i>feel</i> 
	the first sound being pulled out of shape and reformed 
	as something new.  Determining the nature and degree of 
	the mid-point distortion takes considerable thought and, 
	more often than not, experimentation.</li>
	<li>A judicious use of the <i>stagger</i> parameter can 
	help to place the morph section after a portion of unaltered 
	first input and before the end of the second.  This helps 
	to give the ear time to hear the before and after, and 
	also results in a longer output soundfile.</li>
	<li>Some sense of disturbance or warping of the first sound as 
	the morph gets underway can add to the drama and effectiveness 
	of the morph:  you can hear that the first sound has gone 
	awry and don't yet know where it will end up.</li>
	<li>I have been experimenting with amplitude and formant envelope 
	transfers, blurring, transposition, spectral crossing and 
	some aspects of waveshape distortion to achieve this 
	sense of disturbance, with variable degrees of success.</li>
	<li>It is best not to underestimate the challenge of achieving 
	effective audio morphs.</li>
	</ul>
