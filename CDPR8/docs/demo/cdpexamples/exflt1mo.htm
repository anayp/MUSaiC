FILTERS: Detailed Information

<h3>Key Features of the CDP FILTER set</h3>
	<ul>
	<li><b>time-varying Q</b> &#150; the tightness, the degree of 
	focus on the centre pitch of the various filter bands, can 
	vary over time.</li>
	<li><b>time-varying user-defined filter bands</b> &#150; which 
	frequencies are used as the centres of the filter bands, can 
	vary over time.</li>
	<li><b>automatic generation</b> &#150; of filter bands of 
	various types: harmonic, subharmonic etc.</li>
	<li><b>specialist effects</b> &#150; such as <i>sweeping</i> 
	and <i>phasing</i> filters, and repeating the sound with 
	ever-increasing filtering (<i>iterative</i>).</li>
	</ul>

<p>
<h3>Some possible musical results with FILTER</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>Standard Low-pass, High-pass, Band-pass and Band-reject 
	filtering</li>
	<li>Filtering with pre-defined (in the program) types of filter 
	bank: harmonics, alternate harmonics, subharmonics, harmonics with 
	offset, or spaced at equal intervals, possibly with time-varying 
	Q.  One can also create such filter bank files with BANKFREQS and 
	then edit them to suit, or use USERBANK to make use of an original 
	filter bank written with a text editor.</li>
	<li>Filters which sweep through a specified range of frequencies, 
	which may vary over time, with High-pass, Low-pass, Band-pass 
	and Band-reject options, as well as the possibility of time-varying 
	Q: SWEEP.</li>
	<li>A PHASING filter which passes all frequencies while changing 
	their phase relationships.  Softly wavering effects are created.</li>
	<li>Repeating the sound for a specified duration with cumulative 
	(ever-increasing) filtering.  The delay time between iterations can 
	be defined, and may vary over time.</li>
	</ul>

<h3>Other forms of filtering in CDP</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>All the the main forms of filtering (Hi-pass etc.) are 
	also available in the spectral dimension, i.e., operating 
	directly on analysis data.</li>
	<li>In general terms, filtering is a form of data-reduction, 
	and there are many different forms of this in the CDP System.  
	Here are some of them:</li>
		<ul>
		<li>HILITE TRACE retains a specified number of the loudest 
		partials, while BLUR SUPPRESS removes them.</li>
		<li>COMBINE MAX retains the loudest windows of several 
		soundfiles on a window-to-window basis, thus 
		serendipitously mixing the files.</li>
		<li>PITCH ALTHARMS retains either the odd or the even 
		harmonics, removing the others.</li>
		<li>DISTORT DELETE in the Distortion packages time-contracts 
		a sound by deleting wavecycles.</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>

<h3>General observations</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>Lo-pass and High-pass filters can be used to remove 
	unwanted high or low components from a sound.  They can 
	also be used to muffle or brighten a sound.</li>
	<li>Developing a sound by other means of sound transformation 
	is an important part of preparing it before introducing 
	filter effects.</li>
	<li>Change over time, by means of time-varying Q or filter 
	bands, creates timbral variation.  A low Q allows more of 
	the original sound through, while a high Q creates resonant 
	pitched tones. </li>
	<li>It is difficult to ascertain just which frequencies to 
	invoke, but as a general rule, timbral variation results 
	from playing with the upper harmonics, rather than with 
	the area near the fundamental.</li>
	<li>There is often significant loss of volume when filtering.  
	The gain parameter should be set as high as possible, just below 
	a value at which overload occurs.  Some judicious use of 
	GAIN (as in our example) may be needed after filtering.</li>
	</ul>
