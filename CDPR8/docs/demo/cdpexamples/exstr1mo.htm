STRETCHING: Detailed Information
</h1>

<p>
<h3>Key Features</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>Stretching the <b>time</b> of a sound (without changing the pitch) 
		can be thought of as a horizontal process.</li>
	<li>The time stretch can either increase (&gt; 1) or decrease 
		(&lt; 1) the length of the sound.</li>
	<li>Stretching the <b>spectrum</b> of a sound can be thought of as a 
		vertical process.  In this case the stretch factor 
		will expand the frequency relationships inharmonically 
		if &gt; 1, and compress them if &lt; 1.  The timbre 
		of the sound alters significantly.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h3>Some possible musical results with STRETCH techniques:</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>Time stretching can adjust the length of a sound without 
	    altering its pitch.  This allows one to fit the sound to a 
	    required duration.</li>
	<li>The overall result can be made more 'plastic' by using a 
	    time-varying breakpoint file for the stretch factor.
	<li>The time-stretch breakpoint file also makes it possible to 
	    play with the recognisability of the sound, such as 
	    retaining it by having the stretching begin only after 
	    the attack transient.</li>
	<li>Longer time stretches pull out the waveforms sideways, 
	    as it were, and slows down the oscillations.  One starts to 
	    hear the frequency components slowly moving against each 
	    other.</li>
	<li>Long time stretches thus reveal the inner frequency activity 
	    of the sound, making its 'innerness' audible.</li>
	<li>Stretching the spectrum (values &gt; 1) above the frequency 
	    divide tends to brighten the timbre of the sound, creating 
	    inharmonic (non-integer) relationships,</li>
	<li>Compressing the spectrum (values &lt; 1) above the frequency 
	    divide will tend to deepen the tone.</li>
	</ul>

<h3>Other forms of stretching in CDP</h3>
<p>
Stretching Time or Spectrum are special techniques.  We can also 
think about extending (lengthening) a sound in more generic terms.  
CDP contains many different ways to do this.  Here are some of them:
	<ul>
	<li><b>BLUR SHUFFLE:</b> create a pattern by which to shuffle 
		analysis windows, with or without repetitions</li>
	<li><b>BLUR WEAVE:</b> weaving a user-defined path through the 
		windows of an analysis file; patterns can repeat windows 
		and will lengthen the sound</li>
	<li><b>DISTORT REPEAT:</b> <i>N</i> repetitions of (irregular) 
		wavecycles</li>
	<li><b>DISTORT SHUFFLE:</b> create a pattern by which to shuffle 
		(rregular) wavecycles</li>
	<li><b>EXTEND DRUNK:</b> segmentation with time-varying positioning 
		and movement controls</li>
	<li><b>EXTEND LOOP:</b> simple looping of segments end-to-end 
		or overlapped</li>
	<li><b>GrainMill:</b> timestretch of granularised forms of the 
		original sound</li>
	<li><b>TEXTURE:</b> building extended passages from part of or 
		all of a sound, with many time-varying shaping controls</li>
	</ul>

<h3>General observations</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>Stretching is a basic spectral operation that is found 
		in most sound design software.</li>
	<li>Stretching is usually done by a factor of up to about 2 in 
		any one processing operation.  The resultant output is 
		then stretched again an indefinite number of times until 
		the desired sonic result is reached.</li>
	<li>CUT can be applied where appropriate to keep the file 
		being stretched to a reasonable length.  In CDP the 
		analysis file itself can be CUT.</li>
	<li>Long stretch operations can best be achieved by creating 
		a command line batch file or, in the <i>Sound Loom</i> 
		GUI, an 'Instrument' for sequential processing.</li>
	<li>CDP's STRETCH SPECTRUM can expand or compress frequency 
		relationships either above or below a specified 
		frequency divide.  This means that there are four 
		basic function options, and more aural possibilities 
		result from the placement of the frequency divide.
