GRAIN: Detailed Information

<blockquote>
<h3>Key Features of the CDP GRAIN set</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>Includes straightforward time-varying granulation.</li>
	<li>Find and Count grains functions help to set an appropriate 
	<i>gate</i> level (low level which separates grains)</li>
	<li>Supplementary to the main granulation programs &#150; enable 
	a range of specific special effects.</li>
	<li>These effects include changing grain order, pitch, rhythm, 
	duplicating grains, stretching or shrinking the overall sound 
	(but not the grains).</li>
	<li>Chaining effects can be a useful way to achieve interesting 
	results.</li>
	</ul>

<h3>Some possible musical results with GRAIN</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>grain time gaps which expand, contract, or create rhythmic 
	patterns (proportional to the original times between grains)</li>
	<li>patterns which repeat on each grain and therefore cycle round</li>
	<li>cycles of pitch transpositions</li>
	<li>an unusual way to reverse a sound: the grains stay pointing 
	forward, but their order goes from the end to the beginning of 
	the file</li>
	<li>file timewarps which don't affect the length of the grains</li>
	</ul>

<h3>Other forms of granulating in CDP</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>BRASSAGE from Release 3 provides an alternative method of 
	granulation by adjusting three main parameters: segment_size, 
	overlapping, and time_expansion.</li>
	<li>Release 3 SAUSAGE also has a useful cycling pitch transposition 
	function.</li>
	<li>BRASSAGE in Release 4 provides the full complement of 
	granulation techniques, with GRAINMILL as a graphic option 
	with some additional features (PC only).</li>
	<li>TEXTURE creates lengths of soundfile which can be small 
	enough to produce granular effects (or long enough to include 
	the whole input).</li>
	<li>Spectral analysis windows can also be used in a way which 
	produces granular effects, such as by shuffling, weaving or 
	interleaving.</li>
	</ul>

<h3>General observations</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>The CDP <i>GrainMill</i> tutorials set forth a large 
	number of possible effects which can be achieved with the 
	main Granulation programs.</li>
	<li>The GRAIN program set provides another range of 
	possibilities.</li>
	<li>TEXTURE always reads from the beginning of the file for 
	a specified length.  The BRASSAGE and GRAIN programs always 
	move through the whole file.  This is an essential difference 
	between Texture and the Granulation programs proper, a difference 
	which can be used to advantage: Texture enables a more controlled 
	sound, whereas the Granulation programs more easily achieve 
	transitional effects, for example if a time-strectched source 
	is used.</li>
	</ul>
