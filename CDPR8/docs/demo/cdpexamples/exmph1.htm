&#126; CDP Function: MORPH MORPH &#126;</h3><p></p>
	<ul>
	<li>This MORPH function gradually replaces the spectrum of one 
	sound with that of another.</li>
	<li>This process takes account of the fact that the spectrum is 
	constantly evolving over time.</li>
	<li>The timing (start &amp; end) and level of entry (linear or 
	exponential) of the amplitudes and frequencies can be set 
	independently.</li>
	<li>In this example, a double morph is used.  In the first morph, 
	the times are set to 3.5 - 6 in a 6.3 sec file, and 
	<i>stagger</i> is set such that the second input comes in at 3 
	seconds (just before the morph begins).  The times for the second 
	morph are 6.5 - 9 because the use of <i>stagger</i> made the output 
	of the first morph 3 seconds longer.</li>
	<li>The amplitude level of the second input enters slowly and then 
	more rapidly increases (<i>exponent</i> = 2).  The frequencies of 
	the second input come in steadily in a linear fashion 
	(<i>exponent</i> = 1).</li>
	<li>Simple pre-processing helped improve the perception that a 
	morph was taking place.  Firstly, the loudness of the stream was 
	doubled (<i>gain = 2</i>) so that it matched the crackling better.  
	Then the amplitude envelope of the crackling sound replaced that of 
	the stream, producing an <a href="st6genvofck6.mp3"><b>interim 
	state</b></a> in which the stream sounds as if it is being disturbed 
	in some way.</li>
	<li>Finally, the double morph was done:  from the stream into 
	this disturbed stream, and then from the result of this morph into 
	the sound of the crackling itself.</li>
	</ul>

<td bgcolor="#EEE8AA"><h3 align="center">KEY POINTS</h3><p></p>
	<ul>
	<li>Morphing creates a smooth but perceptible transition from 
	one sound to another (usually similar) sound.</li>
	<li>The key to morphing lies in what happens in the transition 
	part of the resulting sound.  One is meant to perceive that 
	transition, to <i>feel it warping</i> into something 
	different.</li>
	<li>Thus, it is not necessarily meant to sound like a MIX or CROSS 
	of two sounds, where the first flows smoothly into the second.  It 
	is the sense of warping out of shape and being reconstituted 
	differently which is the psychoacoustic objective, as clearly 
	seen in the visual dimension.</li>
	<li>The aural process usually needs more time for the transition 
	than the visual one.</li>
	<li>It is not a trivial matter to find an effective way of doing 
	this.  Here, the very lively amplitude envelope of the crackling 
	is extracted and replaces the amplitude envelope of the stream 
	(ENVELOPE REPLACE). </li>
	<li>Then <i>stream</i> is morphed with <i>reshaped amplitude 
	envelope stream</i>, with a 3 second <i>stagger</i> to give 
	time for us to hear the stream in its original form before it 
	starts to change.  When <i>reshaped amplitude stream</i> comes 
	in, it sounds as if the stream is being disturbed by something.</li>
	<li>The last step is to then morph the result of the first morph 
	(stream to disrupted stream) with the crackling sound, also with 
	a <i>stagger</i>, this time 6 seconds, because the first 
	<i>stagger</i> added 3 seconds to the overall length.</li>
	<li>The final result then is <i>stream</i> to <i>stream disrupted 
	by the crackling envelope</i> to the <i>crackling</i>.</li>
	<li>The morph sounds more than a mere transition or crossfade 
	because we have introduced the perception that the first sound 
	(still perceived as being the first sound) has been disrupted in 
	some way.  When the second sound finally emerges, we realise what 
	has caused the disruption.  The perception (it seems to me) is of 
	a stream which has been strongly affected by something, goes 
	brittle and then fragments: an audio morph.</li>
