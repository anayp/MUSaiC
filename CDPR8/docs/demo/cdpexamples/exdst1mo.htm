DISTORT: Detailed Information

<h3>Key Features of the CDP DISTORT set</h3>
	<ul>
	<li><b>Wavecycles</b> are specially defined as that part of a 
	waveshape that lies between zero crossings.  Also called 
	'pseudo-wavecycles' because true waveforms may cross the 
	zero line more than once.  The lengths of the wavecycles 
	defined in this special way differ, which causes the 
	distortion.</li><br>
	<br>
	<li>Various standard procedures are recreated in distorted 
	form by using these special wavecycles as the starting point: 
	e.g., high, low and band pass filtering, time contraction 
	and stretching, shuffling, creating harmonics, lowering and 
	raising frequencies.</li><br>
	<br>
	<li>A more complex form of distortion is achieved by using 
	wavecycles from two different sounds.</li>
	</ul>

<h3>Some possible musical results with DISTORT</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>In general, this form of wavecycle distortion produces a 
	relatively soft-edged burbly sound.  The transformation works 
	its way through the source sound.</li><br>
	<br>
	<li>The source can be time-contracted (DISTORT DELETE, DISTORT 
	OMIT or DISTORT TELESCOPE) or time-extended (DISTORT REPEAT).  
	Further modulating with time-varying enveloping or vibrato functions 
	introduces some variation in the signal.  It can then be interesting 
	to run the result through a fine-grained <i>GrainMill</i> 
	to achieve a smoother but constantly modulating granular 
	texture.</li><br>
	<br>
	<li>Enveloping the wavecycles with DISTORT ENVEL or 
	DISTORT REFORM creates subtle repeating effects, and this can 
	be done with variations in different channels and then 
	recombined to create subtle phased effects.</li><br>
	<br>
	<li>Layering wavecycles with DISTORT FRACTAL or DISTORT HARMONIC 
	creates more complex distortions. </li><br>
	<br>
	<li>The DISTORT FILTER function removes wavecycles of certain 
	lengths, the longer being lower and shorter being higher in 
	pitch: thus the high pass, low pass or band pass effects are 
	created.  DISTORT PITCH also affects the pitch, with time-varying 
	controls over the pitch range and the length of the 
	wavecycles.</li><br>
	<br>
	<li>DISTORT INTERPOLATE provides a powerful combination of 
	repetition and gradual change.  You can specify how many times 
	a given wavecycle is to repeat (causing time-extension and 
	repetitive effects), and during this time it also gradually 
	changes into the next waveycle, causing smoother enveloping 
	and various glissando effects.  I have found it most effective 
	when applied to strong attacks, creating rushing, whistling 
	sounds with lower values for the <i>repeat</i> parameter 
	and mad tin-whistle tunes with higher values.  Spectral-domain 
	timestretching prior to using DISTORT INTERPOLATE produces a 
	finer and smoother texture in the wavecycle repetitions.</li>
	</ul>

<h3>Other forms of distortion in CDP</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>BLUR NOISE introduces noise into the spectrum.</li><br>
	<br>
	<li>BLUR SPREAD spreads the peaks of the spectrum, which 
	also introduces noise.</li><br>
	<br>
	<li>There is a noise element which comes into the attack 
	portion of sounds transformed with HILITE PLUCK.</li><br>
	<br>
	</ul>

<h3>General observations</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>Parameter values close to 1 (above or below) maintain 
	the recognisability of the source.  As values move away from 
	1, the distortions become more extreme and the recognisability 
	of the source diminishes.</li><br>
	<br>
	<li>The DISTORT functions create a variety of distortion 
	effects, from subtle to very intense transformations.</li><br>
	<br>
	<li>One of my favourites is DISTORT REPEAT, which works well 
	with highly modulated sounds, and also produces an extended 
	churning sound which lends itself to further transformations.</li>
	</ul>
