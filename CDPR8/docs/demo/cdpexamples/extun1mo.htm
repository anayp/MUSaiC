PITCH TUNE: Detailed Information
</h1>

<h2 align=center>by Archer Endrich</h2>

<h3>Key Features of the CDP PITCH set</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>In general, these functions are designed for sounds with 
	fairly clear pitch content, rather than complex and noisy sounds.</li>
	<li>Sounds with clear pitch content have partials which are 
	'harmonically' related, that is, the partials are integer 
	multiples of the fundamental (multiplied by whole numbers, not 
	fractions;  e.g., 2, 3, 4, 5 etc.).</li>
	<li>The function ALTHARMS is a typical example of this set, 
	removing either the odd or the even harmonics.</li>
	<li>Similarly, TRANSP, the pitch transposition function in this 
	set, transposes while keeping harmonic relationships.  Thus the 
	original tone of the sound is less changed by the transposition 
	process.</li>
	<li>PICK provides a number of interesting options, such as 
	retaining the partials belonging to the harmonic (overtone) 
	series.</li>
	</ul>

<h3>Some possible musical results with PITCH TUNE</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>This example uses a clear pitch produced by a French Horn.  
	After the tuning operation, we clearly hear the chord we defined.  
	PITCH TUNE is very effective in producing a clear, chordal result.</li>
	<li>When applied to a complex sound, such as the running water 
	used in another of the examples, tuning does take place, but 
	is heard as a soft chord 'behind' the foreground sound of the 
	water.  Thus, even with the same settings, many partials are 
	not affected.</li>
	<li>One interesting application is to use this tuning with 
	source material that contains both pitched and unpitched 
	features.  The pitched sounds come through as clear chords, 
	while the unpitched, though less affected, is nevertheless 
	still 'warmed' by the tuning process.</li>
	<li>Note that this function is limited to one chord definition.  
	It does not handle changing chords as does FILTER VARIBANK, 
	used in the example for FILTERS.</li>
	</ul>

<h3>Other forms of tuning in CDP</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>The main alternative to PITCH TUNE are the various FILTER 
	programs, also very effective, with time-varying frequency band 
	definitions, Q etc.  Considerable clarity in the tuning can 
	be achieved with the FILTER programs, but only when the Q is 
	set rather high.  This can produce more resonance than 
	desirable (your speakers will notice).  PITCH TUNE creates 
	the clarity (with pitched sounds) without a resonance by-product.</li>
	<li>One should also mention the functions which move harmonic 
	relationships towards inharmonic ones, such as STRANGE SHIFT, 
	which moves partials by a fixed multiplier.  This squeezes or 
	expands the partials in a linear fashion, thus breaking the 
	exponential nature of harmonic relationships (octaves double 
	the previous frequency).</li>
	<li>One would think that PITCH CHORD would produce results 
	similar to PITCH TUNE, but this is not the case.  Some tuning 
	occurs due to the internal transpositions taking place, but it 
	is, in my experience, a rougher effect, dealing with the whole 
	spectrum rather than focusing on the specified pitches as does 
	PITCH TUNE.</li>
	</ul>

<p>
Let's go back to this idea of locating the Peak Energy Bands (PEB) within 
the spectrum of the sound.  SPECINFO PEAK gives us the following

10<sup><small>th</small></sup> of a second.):<br>

This shows us that the main energy band is, throughout the duration of the 
sound, between 400 Hz (just under the A above Middle C) and 565 Hz (between 
High C&#35; and High D).  Most of the pitches of our tuning template are 
in fact outside this band, but the range of tuning pitches includes the band, 
which appears to be sufficient.  The full range of frequencies in the 
display is 200 to 2262, which does cover most of the pitches in the 
tuning template.  (The 50 Hz frequency with which the display begins 
was in fact set in the dialogue box.)
