<h2>
Stage 1: prepare a thin, descending, vibrating filament
</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>
<b>Source:</b> a single stroke on a Tibetan singing bowl<a href="bellae.wav">
<b>bellae.wav</b></a> (4.9 sec).
</p>

<p>
The first step is to soften the attack and make the ending of the sound 
more gradual.  This is done with DOVETAIL, with 1 sec. of exponential 
curve (the rate of amplitude increase accelerates) at the beginning, 
and 1 second of linear slope (steady rate of decrease) at the end.  The 
output is named <a href="bdtG5.wav"><b>bdtG5.wav</b></a>.
</p>

<p>
The next step is to make it more supple by giving it a slow oscillation, 
moving between harmonic and inharmonic states &#150; using STRANGE WAVER, 
we hear it get a bit tighter and thinner as it goes up.  The <i>rate of 
oscillation</i> is 4 x per second (0.25), but a <i>timestretch</i> factor of 
5 slows this down considerably.  The <i>lowest frequency</i> affected is 
50 Hz:  <a href="bdtG5wavr.mp3"><b>bdtG5wavr.mp3</b></a>.
</p>

<p>
Now we need to make this sound longer, so TIMESTRETCH the sound by a 
<i>factor</i> of times 2.3:  <a href="bdtG5wavrstrx2&3.mp3">
<b>bdtG5wavrstrx2&3.mp3</b></a>.  It is now 11 seconds long, and we 
have a nice long wavy filament.
</p>

<p>
The descending glissando aspect is achieved with STRANGE SHIFT, with 
which we push the sound upwards by 3000 Hz and have it gradually drop 
back down to its original frequency level over its 11 second duration.  
This uses a <i>time value</i> breakpoint file for the <i>shift_factor</i>:

<div>
<pre>
TIME	VALUE
 0	3000
11	   5
</pre>
</div>

Now the filament is a long, thin descending glissando: 
<a href="bdtG5wavrstrx2&3ss.mp3"><b>bdtG5wavrstrx2&3ss.mp3</b></a>
</p>

<p>
The desire to have the sound 'vibrate' leads us to further enhance 
this sound with a time-varying vibrato.  So we start off with 1 
vibrato per second and end with 30 per second.  This information is 
provided in another breakpoint file for the <i>vibrato_factor</i>:

<div>
<pre>
TIME	VALUE
 0	  1
11	 30
</pre>
</div>

This is the result: <a href="bdtG5wavrstrx2&3ssvib.mp3">
<b>bdtG5wavrstrx2&3ssvib.mp3</b></a>.  This final enhancement 
is judged to provide a sufficient basis for creating a flowing 
wall/curtain/veil of these filaments, so we move on to Stage 2.
</p>

<h2>
Stage 2:  create a flowing, vibrating wall of glissandos
</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>
The plan is to use TEXTURE SIMPLE, mode 3 to pack these filaments 
closer together:  0.1 sec apart, with a 0.05 timing offset.  The 
richness of the texture is further improved by providing a 3-pitch 
harmonic set: D-F-G.  This means that each of the note events, spaced 
at ca. 1/10<sup><small>th</small></sup> of a second, will be randomly 
placed on either D, F or G above Middle C.  At such a close temporal 
spacing, this means that there will be a 3-note chord of descending 
glissandos.
</p>

<p>
Now we have reached our goal of a descending, vibrating wall of sound:
<a href="tz5s2tex3.mp3"><b>tz5s2tex3.mp3</b></a>, used for the 
2<sup><small>nd</small></sup> section of the 5<sup><small>th</small></sup> 
Tzolkin cycle.
