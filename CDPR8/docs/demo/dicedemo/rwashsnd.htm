<i><b>Goal:</b> a wash of rhythms that expands and contracts</i>

<h2>
Stage 1: make a light sound for rapid rhythms
</h2>

<blockquote>

<div>
<p>
<b>Source:</b> a single stroke on a Tibetan singing bowl: <a href="bellae.wav">
<b>bellae.wav</b></a> (4.9 sec).
</p>
</div>

<p>
The preparatory sequence of operations takes the source to a Hi-Pass 
filtered version of bellae.wav: GAIN reduction by 0.7, CUT from the 
beginning to 1.1 sec., and DOVETAIL ca. 0.25 sec. linear at the beginning, 
and 0.85 second exponential at the end, forming: <a href="baegcdt.wav">
<b>baegcdt.wav</b></a>.  This is put through a HI-PASS FILTER with the 
<i>passband</i> at 1568 Hz and the <i>stopband</i> at 10 Hz:  everything 
above 1568 Hz is retained, and frequencies below it are gradually 
filtered away.  The output is CUT again 0 to 1.1 sec.  This gives us 
<a href="baegcdthipc.mp3"><b>baegcdthipc.mp3</b></a>.  A slightly 
'lighter' version, exact parameters not known, possibly a higher 
<i>passband</i>, and TRANSPOSED up 4 semitones to B-natural (MPV=71) 
is the variant actually used: <a href="baegcdthip2cu4.mp3">
<b>baegcdthip2cu4.mp3</b></a>.

<h2>
Stage 2: create the rhythmic texture
</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>
We are aiming for a texture made up of lively rhythms, not separate, 
but forming a wash that expands downwards & contracts again, a jostling 
together of driving, energetic rhythmic units.  Another objective is 
to have a harmonic flavour.  The function to achieve these objectives 
is TEXTURE TMOTIFSIN: Timed-MOTIFS-IN (changing harmonic sets).
</p>

<p>
The rhythmic motif created for this texture is:
<div>
<IMG SRC="rhywashrhythm.gif"></a>
</div>
and a duration template specifies that it repeats every &#189; second.  
This rhythm is actually specified in numbers:  the first 4 semiquavers 
start at times 0, 0.25, 0.5 and 0.75 sec.  The tempo is then doubled 
to bring it to crotchet = 120.
</p>

<p>
The &#189; sec. duration template is the 'timed' part of the function.
This &#189; sec. overlap of the rhythmic motif is what makes it 
sound continous.  A sextuplet is included in the motif to help make 
the rhythms jostle together and fuse into a continuum.
</p>

<p>
The harmonic flavour is achieved by starting and ending on its original 
pitch (B-natural), unfurling a 6-note chord and then contracting back 
to the B.  Using the 'changing harmonic set' option in TEXTURE TMOTIFSIN, 
Mode 3 for 'changing harmonic sets', the chord changes every 2 or 3 
seconds as shown below:
<div>
<p>
<IMG SRC="rhywashhs.gif"></a>
</p>
</div>
These pitches are specified as MPVs: MIDI Pitch Values.  Thus the full 
chord, reading upwards, is 61-62-65-67-68-71.  The output duration is 
specified as 20 seconds, which is why the numbers under the chords 
go up to 20.  These define the time periods during which each set of 
pitches can be used.
</p>

<p>
Thus the constraints (specifications) for the texture include a 
duration template, a harmonic set with 11 changes, and a rhythmic 
motif.
</p>

<p>
The software that builds the rhythmic wash texture to these specifications 
starts the rhythmic motif every half a second, transposing the input sound 
to the pitches available in each output time period, selecting one 
of the available pitches at random.  The whole motif plays through on the 
selected pitch.  The overall expanding and contracting shape of the texture 
is very clearly audible.  This is what it sounds like:  
<a href="baegcdthip2cu4tz1s5.mp3"><b>baegcdthip2cu4tz1s5.mp3</b></a>.  The 
last part of the name indicates that it is used as the 
5<sup><small>th</small></sup> section of the 1<sup><small>st</small></sup> 
<i>Tzolkin</i> cycle of the piece.
</p>

<p>
Aesthetically, this short texture draws upon various 
20<sup><small>th</small></sup> century developments in the way music 
is put together, particularly the creation of textures which have both 
free (randomised) and defined components.
</p>
