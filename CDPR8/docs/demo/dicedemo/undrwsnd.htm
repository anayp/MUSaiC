<h2>
Stage 1: prepare a deep, soft, resonant bubble
</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>
<b>Source:</b> a hog-like animal cry, CUT from a soundfile containing 
the cries of several different animals: <a href="hog.wav">
<b>hog.wav</b></a> (3.7 sec).
</p>

<p>
Initial processing begins with some housekeeping work.  <i>Gain</i> x 2 
is applied to give it a reasonable amplitude: 
<a href="hogg.mp3"><b>hogg.mp3</b></a>.  This then DOVETAILED to 
give it a strong, but controlled attack transient (0.5 sec, starting 
slowly and the rising in amplitude more quickly &#150; the 'exponential' 
setting) and a smooth decay (smooth linear decay over 1 sec.).  Now 
we have  <a href="hoggdt.mp3"> <b>hoggdt.mp3</b></a>.
</p>

<p>
The sound is first transformed by RING MODULATION.  1000 Hz is both 
added to and subtracted from the original sound, creating a 1000 Hz 
empty zone in the middle:  <a href="hoggdtrm.mp3"><b>hoggdtrm.mp3</b></a>.
</p>

<p>
The second transformation process is FILTERBANK SUBHARMONIC, i.e., 
filter the sound through a bank, a descending series of resonant 
frequency centres.<br />
<br />
<br />

<div>
<pre>
  Q	GAIN	HIFRQ --> LOFRQ
75	25	1000	  100
</pre>
</div>

The 'double-filtering' option is used in order to increase the 
resonant effect.  The somewhat amazing result is:  
<a href="hoggdtrmfsub.mp3"><b>hoggdtrmfsub.mp3</b></a>, which is 
CUT to 4 sec. duration to create the final result:
<a href="hoggdtrmfsubc.mp3"><b>hoggdtrmfsubc.mp3</b></a>.
</p>

<h2>
Stage 2 &#150; create the series of descending bubbles
</h2>

<p>
The desired long, descending, deep-down, resonant bubble texture 
is achieved with TEXTURE SIMPLE, Mode 4 (changing harmonic sets), 
with an output duration of 50 seconds.  The <i>event-density</i> is 
a slow 2.4 seconds, widely offset by up to 0.7 seconds.
</p>

<p>
The key to the creation of this texture is providing 3 descending 
pairs of pitches in such a way that the software selects at random 
which pitch of the pair it will use for any given note event.  Thus 
you will hear the final texture oscillate unpredictably between 
the pitches of each pair.  The input sound made for this 
texture is very long, so the various iterations of the sound 
overlap a great deal.  This overlap makes the movement downwards to 
the next pair of pitches very smooth, as the sounds on the previous 
pitches are still ringing on.
</p>

<p>
These are the pairs of pitches, with the times at which they change 
indicated below the stave:
<div>
<IMG SRC="pitchpairs.gif"></a>
</div>
Only these pitches are used:  all notes are snapped to the specified 
harmonic set pairs during each of the time periods when they are 
active.
</p>

<p>
In the final result, then, we can hear a slow, irregular movement, 
and an unpredictable oscillation between pairs of pitches, with the 
overlapping bubbles gradually descending over the 50 second period. 
A little GAIN is applied to restore some of the volume loss during 
filtering.
