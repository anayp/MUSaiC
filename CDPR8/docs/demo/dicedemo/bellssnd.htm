<h2>
Sequence 1: contrasting tones
</h2>


<!-- 
<a href=".mp3"><b>.mp3</b></a> 
 -->

<blockquote>

<p>
These tones need to be short because they are intended for rapid, 
multi-event textures.  Se we CUT the source from 0 to 1.1 seconds 
and lightly DOVETAIL the start and finish.  I can't find the exact 
values for this dovetail;  a close approximation is 0.25 second 
fade-in, linear, and 0.85: exponential decay.  The outcome of these 
two operations is <a href="baegcdt.wav"><b>baegcdt.wav</b></a> 
</p>

<p>
Here are four sounds made with this version of the original source:
	<ol>
	<li>HI-PASS FILTER &#150:  <a href="baegcdthipc.mp3">
	<b>baegcdthipc.mp3</b></a> is produced with a Pass frequency 
	of 1568 Hz and a Stop frequency of 10:  everything above 
	the Pass frequency is retained, and everything below it, down 
	to 10 Hz, the bottom of the sound, is gradually filtered away.</li>
	<li>EQUAL INTERVALS FILTER &#150; <a href="baegcdthipcei.mp3">
	<b>baegcdthipcei.mp3</b></a> results when the filter bands are set 
	at equal intervals of 100 Hz, using the Hi-Pass Filter result 
	as input.  This is set to occur between 100 and 3200 Hz, with 
	a <i>Gain</i> of 6 to compensate for the filtering, and a <i>Q</i> 
	(filter focus) of 200, which is fairly high.</li>
	<li>SHRED &#150; <a href="baegcdtshred2.mp3">
	<b>baegcdtshred2.mp3</b></a> shows how the shredding operation 
	breaks up the sound.  The parameters here were set to 3 <i>repeats</i>, 
	<i>average_duration</i> (of the shreds) at 0.2 seconds, and 
	<i>random_scatter</i> of 3 (where in the sound the shreds are 
	taken from).</li>
	<li>SUBHARMONIC FILTER &#150; <a href="baegcdtsubh4dt.mp3">
	<b>baegcdtsubh4dt.mp3</b></a> is a soft plunk remaining after 
	subharmonic filtering between a <i>high_frequency</i> of 1000 and 
	a <i>low_frequency</i> of 50, with a great deal of <i>Gain</i>: 53, 
	and a high <i>Q</i> (filter focus): 350.  A DOVETAIL smooths out 
	the beginning and the end, values not specified in my notes.</li>

<h2>
Sequence 2: a very soft, lightly bubbling sound
</h2>

<!-- 
<a href=".mp3"><b>.mp3</b></a>   
 -->

<blockquote>

<p>
This time the 4.9 second baeg.wav source is CUT between 1 and 4.9 
seconds, i.e., a whole second of the <b>attack transient</b> is removed.  The 
edges are greatly smoothed with exponential DOVETAILS of 1 second both 
at the beginning and the end.  The use of exponential here (effect starts 
slowly and gets faster) is designed to maximise the length of the 
sustain part of the sound.  We therefore end up with a gentle and 
resonant sound: <a href="bresdte.wav"><b>bresdte.wav</b></a> .
</p>

<p>
FOCUS ACCUMULATE introduces a slow glissando inside the partials 
of the sound, by accumulating data across several time zones of 
the sound (analysis windows).  The <i>glissando</i> is set at 2.8 octaves 
per second and the sound is tidied up with GAIN x 2 and a DOVETAIL 
which doesn't alter the beginning (0.02 sec.) and brings the end 
down to silence over 0.5 sec. with an exponential curve.  Our 
2<sup><small>nd</small></sup> Sequence results in 
<a href="bresdteaccu2&8gdt.mp3"><b>bresdteaccu2&8gdt.mp3</b></a>.  
I can't work out why there's a rapid fluttering towards the end &#150; 
perhaps it's caused by the exponential curve.
</p>

<p>
<br />
</p>

<h2>
Sequence 3: richly modulating sounds
</h2>

<!-- 
<a href=".mp3"><b>.mp3</b></a>   
 -->

<blockquote>

<p>
Now we set off to make some big changes.  The original baeg.wav 
is DOVETAILED with 1 second slopes at the beginning and the end, 
this time with the beginning exponential (rises increasingly faster) 
and the end linear (steady reduction in amplitude).  This gives 
us <a href="bdtG5.wav"><b>bdtG5.wav</b></a> .
</p>

<p>
Time-varying RING MODULATION makes a big change to the sound.  
Ring modulation both adds and subtracts a given frequency, thus 
splitting the sound by pushing its frequencies both upwards and downwards.  
In this case, it does this by different amounts at different 
times &#150; all rather small amounts, as specified in <i>bdtrm.brk</i>:
<p>
<br />
<br />
</p>
<div>
<pre>
TIME	MODULATION_FREQUENCY
0.0	15
1.2	25
3.0	17
4.5	20
</pre>
</div>
The <i>modulation_frequency</i> changes gradually here, e.g., moving 
gradually from 15 to 25 Hz over the first 1.2 seconds.  Thus it is 
changing all the time, undulating between the modulation frequencies 
provided.  Now our sound is: <a href="bdtrmtv1.mp3">
<b>bdtrmtv1.mp3</b></a>.  The letters 'tv' in the output soundfile name 
refer to this time-varying modulation frequency.
</p>

<p>
The amplitude is a little low after this operation, so we raise it by 
a <i>factor</i> of 1.7 with GAIN:  <a href="bdtrmtv1g.mp3">
<b>bdtrmtv1g.mp3</b></a>.  The next transformation might work better 
if the sound were a little lower, so we move it down 2 semitones without 
changing its length by using REPITCH TRANSPOSE:<a href="bdtrmtv1gd2.mp3">
<b>bdtrmtv1gd2.mp3</b></a>.
</p>

<p>
Now we're ready for the final step in this sequence which is to SHUFFLE 
the internal order of the sound.  This is a wavecycle DISTORTION process 
which rearranges little time-zones (analysis windows) of the sound.  
It increases the length because we create an extended pattern of 
rearragements which repeats in cycles.  The pattern has a <i>domain</i> 
part which names three letters: <b>abc</b> and an <i>image</i> part 
which duplicates them 3 times in a different order: <b>cab-acb-bca</b>.  
[The hyphens aren't used;  they are only put here for clarity.]  This 
new <i>image</i> repeats in 5 <i>cycle_groups</i> and gives us:
<a href="bdtrmtv1gd2shuf5.mp3"><b>bdtrmtv1gd2shuf5.mp3</b></a>, 
which is quite a long way from our original sound.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
<br />
</p>

<h2>
Sequence 4: a warm, vibrant tone
</h2>

<!-- 
<a href=".mp3"><b>.mp3</b></a> 
 -->

<blockquote>

<p>
This sound begins with yet another CUT & DOVETAIL operation applied 
to <a href="baeg.wav"><b>baeg.wav</b></a> :
	<ul>
	<li>DOVETAIL &#150; 0.5 linear at the beginning and 0.3 linear 
	at the end: <a href="baegdt.mp3"><b>baegdt.mp3</b></a> 
	<li>CUT &#150; 0.65 to 4.9 (more of the attack, but still 
	missing its first &#189; sec. or so: <a href="baegdtc.mp3">
	<b>baegdtc.mp3</b></a> 
	<li>DOVETAIL &#150; 0.05 exponential at the beginning and 
	0.3 linear at the end: <a href="baeg3cdt.mp3">
	<b>baeg3cdt.mp3</b></a>.
	</ul>
</p>

<p>
The next step is to enrich this rather gentle sound by TRANSPOSING 
it <b>up</b> and <b>down</b> by a mere <b>0.1</b> semitone (10 cents) 
&#150; more than this gives beat interference patterns which we don't 
want here.  This gives three versions which are then MIXED together, 
all starting at time 0 but with slightly different amplitude levels.  
This is the MIX file <i>baeg3mx.mix</i>:

<pre>
SOUNDFILE		START_TIME  CHANNELS	LEVEL  PAN
baeg3cdt.mp3			0	1	0.85	0
baeg3cdtu&1.mp3		0	1	0.75	0
baeg3cdtd&1.mp3		0	1	0.9	0
</pre>

and this is the result: <a href="baeg3mix.mp3"><b>baeg3mix.mp3</b></a>.  
Another CUT (0 to 2 sec.) and DOVETAIL 0.01 linear at the start (i.e., 
virtually no change) and 0.6 linear at the end (smooth decay) gives 
us our tidied up results: <a href="baeg3mixcdt.mp3">
<b>baeg3mixcdt.mp3</b></a>.
</p>

<p>
This subtly enriched, gentle sound shows its special qualities in 
an arpeggio texture: soft, with a strange resonant, reverberant 
character.  Describing how these arpeggios are made goes beyond the 
scope of this series of examples, so we can just listen to the result: 
<a href="baeg3mixcdtflob1mtf.mp3"><b>baeg3mixcdtflob1mtf.mp3</b></a> 
(random factors make it deliberately irregular in its timing.)
