</div>

<h2>GENERAL</h2>
<br>
<h3><i>Return</i> and <i>Escape</i> keys: Rationalised usage:</h3>
<ul>
In almost all circumstances <br><br>
<ul>
<li><b><i>Return</b></i> means "<b>DO IT</b>" (or Quit if there is nothing to do)
<li><b><i>Escape</b></i> means "<b>DON'T DO IT</b>" (equivalent to <b>Quit</b>, <b>Abandon</b> or <b>Close</b>).
</ul>
<br>
with one or two exception ....<br><br>
<ul>    
<li>In windows where text can be <b>edited</b>, <b><i>Return</i></b> is a valid character to type into the window
so <b>cannot</b> be used to mean "DO IT". 
<br>
(In these windows <b><i>Control s</i></b> or <b><i>Control S</b></i> will Save the text data).
<br><br>
<li>If there is any <b>ambiguity</b> about what is to be done, the <i>Return</i> key will <b>not</b> be active.
<br><br>
</ul>
In the previous release, the <i>Escape</i> key was used to proceed through the normal processing sequence i.e.
<br><br>
<ul>    
<li>Workspace -> Process Page
<li>(<i>If using same process again</i>) Process Page -> Parameters Page.
<li>Parameters Page -> Run Page
<li>Do Run
<li>(<i>If required, but see below</i>) Run Page -> Parameters Page, for naming the output.
</ul>
<br>
<b>You should now use use <i>Return</i> instead</b>.
<br><br>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>Ignoring routine messages on the <i>Run</i> page:</h3>
<ul>    
If you want to ignore routine messages (those that are neither Warnings nor Errors) on the <b>Run</b> page<br>
(and hence automatically exit directly back to the parameters page once a process runs successfully)<br>
there is a new option under <b>SYSTEM SETTINGS 1</b> on the <b>SYSTEM</b> menu on the Workspace<br>
to <b>IGNORE/DISPLAY ROUTINE PROGRAM MESSAGES</b>.
<br><br>
To <b><i>Restore</b></i> messaging, use the same menu item.
</ul>
<br>    
<h3>Universal <i>End Session</i> Shortcut:</h3>
<ul>    
On Any page with an <b>End Session</b> button, <b><i>Control-Alt-Escape</i></b> will also end the session.<br>
(<b><i>Control-Command-Escape</i></b> on the MAC).
</ul>
<br>
    
<h3>Creation Date display:</h3>
<ul>
The creation date of any selected file on the Workspace page, can be displayed, using the  <b><i>F12</b></i> Key.
<br><br>    
It can also be used to date <b>Thumbnails</b> on the Thumbnails editing page,<br>
and files waiting to be backed up on the <b>FILES TO BACK UP</b> page (see next item).<br>
<br>
If you select <b><i>two</b></i> files, their Creation dates will be <b>compared</b>.
</ul>
<br>    
    
<h3>Displaying files that have been Created, Modified or Deleted:</h3>
<ul>
If you wish to keep a record of files that have been created, modified or deleted<br>
(for example, in order to know which files you need to backup to an external storage medium)<br>
there is now a new option on the <b>SYSTEM</b> menu, under <b>SYSTEM SETTINGS 2</b>.
<br><br>
<b>OPTION TO MAKE LOG OF FILE CHANGES</b>
<br><br>    
If you select this option, the Loom keeps a log of any files created, deleted or modified during the session,<br>
(except for those stil in the Workspace <i>base directory</i>**).<br>
It also keeps a record of any modifications to mixfiles<br>
(e.g. when soundfiles <i>within</i> the mixfile are renamed, backed-up or deleted).<br>
<br>
This log is displayed at the start and end of each session.<br>
When it is displayed, if you have already copied the listed sounds to an external storage medium<br>
(or you intend to do so), the log can be deleted.<br>
<br>
If you decide <b>not</b> to copy the files to an external storage medium at this time<br>
the log will be preserved, and any further file modifications added to it.<br>
<br>
The listing is intelligently managed, e.g.
<ul>
<li>A file created and later deleted is removed from the lists.
<li>If a file <b>xxx</b> is deleted, and later a new file is created with the same name (<b>xxx</b>),<br>
file <b>xxx</b>  is listed as <i>modified</i>.
</ul>
<br>    
** Files in the workspace base directory i.e. with no pathname in the workspace listing,<br>
are assumed to be provisional. Backing them up to a directory declares you want to keep them.
</ul>    
<br>
<h2>WORKSPACE PAGE</h2>

<h3>Keyboard Shortcuts:</h3>
<ul>    
<li><b>Return</b>: proceed to the Process Page.
<br><br>    
<li>On the <b>Directory listing</b> it is now possible to hilight specific <b>types</b> of file,<br>
using keyboard shortcuts similar to those used for the same purpose on the workspace.<br>
e.g. <Alt-a> (or <Cmd-a> on the MAC) highlights all analysis files on the Workspace.<br>
<br>
The new convention is that
<ul>
<li><b>Lower case</b> letters do the highlighting on the <i>Workspace listing</i>.
<li><b>Upper case</b> letters do the highlighting on the <i>Directory listing</i>.
</ul>
<br>
(Note that, on the workspace, properties of files are known and can be used to determine file type,<br>
whereas on the Directory listing, searches can only rely on the file extensions of listed files).<br>
<br>
As a result, changes to some existing shortcut keys have been made.
<br><br>
<ul>
<li><b>mUltichannel files</b> are now highlighted using <b>Alt u</b> or <b>Alt U</b>.
<li><b>SoundList textfiles</b> (<i><b>o</b>rchestras</i>) are now highlighted using <b>Alt o</b> or <b>Alt O</b>.
<li><b>Sound Files</b> are now highlighted using <b>Alt s</b> or <b>Alt S</b>.
<li><b>Property files</b> are <b>Alt-p</b> on the workspace but <b>Alt-Q</b> on the Directory Listing.
<li><b>Home</b> (as before) lists the <b>entire</b> directory on the Directory Listing.
<br><br>
(On the MAC, use <b>Command</b> instead of <b>Alt</b>)
</ul>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>Displaying Difference in Duration between 2 soundfiles:</h3>
<ul>
A new entry on the <b>SELECTED FILES</b>: <b>PROPERTIES</b> menu, <b>DURATION DIFFERENCE</b>
<br>
returns the difference in duration between 2 selected files.
</ul>
<h3>Improved interface for comparing textfiles:</h3>
<ul>
<b>SELECTED FILES OF TYPE</b>: <b>COMPARE SELECTED FILES</b>.<br>
Now has a better interface for comparing textfiles (e.g. previous and current mixfile).
<br>
</ul>
<br>
<h2>MUSIC TESTBED</h2>
<ul>
<b>Multichannel Shred</b>, <b>Multichannel Zigzag</b> and <b>Multichannel Iterate</b><br>
now function correctly on the <b>MULTICHAN</b> menu on the Process Page.<br>
<br>
They have therefore been removed from the MUSIC TESTBED menu.
</ul>
<br>

</ul>    
<br>
<h2>RUN PAGE</h2>

<h3>New Keyboard Shortcuts</h3>
<ul>    
<li><b>Return</b>:  Proceed to run the process + (if necessary) acknowledge process completion.<br>
<br>
Note that completion-acknowledgement can be avoided by setting the new option to<br>
IGNORE/DISPLAY ROUTINE PROGRAM MESSAGES on the SYSTEM menu on the Workspace (see above).
<br><br>
<li><b>Escape</b>:  Abort, abandoning the process and its output.
</ul>    
<br>
<h2>TEXTFILE EDITING PAGE</h2>
   
<h3>Keyboard Shortcuts</h3>
<ul>    
<li><b>Control s</b> or <b>Control S</b> saves the content of the text window to a file.
<br><br>    
<li>Keyboard Shortcuts for entering Musical Meter:
<br><br>    
On some textfile-editing pages, various keys can already be used for entering musical meter.<br>
These are now listed (where relevant) under a new "<b>K</b>" Key at the top left of the page.
<br><br>    
Where a Click-track is being created, additional shortcut keys are listed.
</ul><br>    

<h2>QIKEDIT PAGE</h2>

    
<h3>New Keyboard Shortcuts</h3>
<ul>    
<li><b>Return</b>:  Keep the edited mixfile, and quit.
<li><b>Escape</b>:  Abandon any edits, and quit.
<br><br>    
<li><b>Control-s</b> (<b>Spatialisaion</b>)<br>
when one mixfile line is selected, this gives a graphic display of the loudspeaker routing for that line.
</ul>    
<h3>New or Expanded Qikedit Functions</h3>
<ul>   
<li><b>SWAP MUTING PAIR</b> replaced by the more general <b>SWAP MUTE/NOT</b>:
<br><br>
this simultaneously unmutes any muted lines in your selection, and mutes any unmuted lines,<br>
allowing groups of muted and unmuted lines to be exchanged as active participants in the mix.
<br><br>    
<li><b>REROUTE</b> : "<b><</b>" "<b>></b>" "<b><></b>"  and "<b>><</b>" for copying/exchanging routing patterns between lines.<br>
<br>
Previously lines had to have the same number of input channels,<br>
and the routing of input channels in one line was changed to the routing of input channels in the other.
<br><br>
Now, this also also works for lines which have the same number of <b>Output Routes</b>.<br>
The output destination of each route in one line is changed to the output destination of each route in the other.
<br><br>
Where there is ambiguity, you are asked to clarify which of these 2 possibilities you intend.
<br><br>
<li> New <b>MaxChan</b> button finds and displays the value and time of the maximum level in each channel.<br>
(This function is also accessible from the <b>PLAY CHANS</b> window).
</ul>
</ul>
<br>
<h2>BUG FIXES & IMPROVEMENTS</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>MOVE TO NEW DIRECTORY</b> with a list including a mixfile, and files within that mix,<br>
did not always update the mixfile management information correctly. Fixed.
<br><br>
<li><b>PLAY CHANS</b> on <b>QikEdit</b> page and<br>
<b>PLAY SINGLE CHANNEL OF MULTICHAN FILE</b> on <b>MUSIC TESTBED</b><br>
did not work in all cases. Fixed.
<br><br>
<li>QIKEDIT:
<ul>    
<li><b>MIRROR</b> and <b>MOVE TIME</b> -type operations: Muted versions of original lines not generated in v12.0.8. Fixed.
<li><b>SOUNDS TO SUBMIX</b> : gave incorrect filename extension for multichannel mixes. Fixed.
<li><b>SOUNDS TO SUBMIX</b> & <b>SOUNDS TO WKSPACE</b> no longer ask if the mixfile is to be backed up<br>
if no changes have been made to the submix.
</ul>
<br>
<li>If <b>PLAY AND RENAME</b> was chosen when no playable files selected, window did not disappear. Fixed.
</ul>
