<a name="INS">Installing the CDP Sound Loom</a>
</h2>

<blockquote>
<ul>

<p>
<li>
See the <b>AboutRelease6-SystemInfo.txt</b> about installing <i>Sound 
Loom</i> and setting up the CDP System generally.  Ensure that the sound 
file extension environment variable is set.
</p>

</ul>

<a name="LAU">Launch Sound Loom and configure the options</a>
</h2>

<blockquote>
<ol> 

	<blockquote>
	<p>
	<b>You may wish to launch the <i>Sound Loom</i> from the desktop.</b> 
	To make this possible...
	<ul>
	<p>
	<li>
	Using <b>Finder</b> or <b>Windows Explorer</b>, find the file 
	<i>soundloom</i> in the directory where you have installed the 
	<i>Sound Loom</i> (usually /cdpr6/_cdp).
	</p>

	<p>
	<li>
	Create a desktop shortcut the using appropriate Mac or PC procedure.
	</p>

	<p>
	<li>
	An icon will now appear on the desktop. (You can rename the icon.) 
	</p>
	</ul>
	</blockquote>

<p>
<li>
To launch the <i>Sound Loom </i> double-click on the desktop icon you have created, OR in <b>Finder</b> or <b>Windows Explorer</b>, double-click on 
the application file <i>soundloom</i> in the directory listing.</li>
</p>

<p>
<li>
Once the <i>Sound Loom</i> is launched, you will be asked to specify various features 
relating to your particular system, especially whether you want a single-user or 
multi-user system. <b>Note that you can always change your mind later</b> about all 
such features via the <i>System State</i> menu on the <i>Workspace</i> 
page of the <i>Sound Loom</i>.
</p>

<p>
<li>
One of these features, <b>typical sample size</b>, is used by the <i>Music Calculator</i> 
(a <i>Sound Loom</i> accessory) when you ask it to convert from loudness to sample-value or 
vice-versa but it <b>does not affect the rest of the Sound Loom's operation</b>. 
If in doubt, leave the default value in place.  Using a single sample rate consistently 
will facilitate your use of the CDP System.
</p>

<p>
<li>
Once the Sound Loom  is running, you will have access to <b>New User Help</b> through the 
<i>New User Help</i> buttons on each page. (<i>This is quite separate from the normal 
<b>Help</b> facility, which is also available</i>). You can get rid of the 
<i>New User Help</i> facility once you no longer need it.
</p>

<p>
<li>
In addition, the normal <b>Help</b> buttons will inform you about the function of every 
button, menu or other feature on each major page of the <i>Sound Loom</i>. Furthermore, 
on the <i>Process Page</i>, the <b>Info</b> and <b>Which?</b> buttons provide 
information about available CDP processes, and on the <i>Parameters Page</i> the 
<b>Information</b> button gives more detailed information about the particular process 
you have chosen to run.
</p>

<a name="#LEG">Sound Loom Legibility</a>
</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>
Various factors can affect legibility.  The main factor is font and 
font size, which are discussed below.  These are set via the <i>Sound 
Loom</i> <b>Redesign</b> page.  (I am not sure to what degree this 
might be relevant for Version 13 of <i>Sound Loom</i> &#150; AE.)
</p>

<p>
Another factor, which you might try before going on to font and font size 
is whether you have a large or small monitor screen display area.  
If you have a small one, you may find that the <b>Workspace</b> does 
not fit on it, and that there is no way to move it.
</p>

<blockquote>
If you click on the SYSTEM STATE button on the Workspace, you are given 
the option to <b>Set screen size</b>:  i.e., to select a large screen 
display or a small screen display.  If you select the latter, the 
<b>Workspace</b> will be displayed in a smaller window, with the addition 
of sliders which you can use to access any parts of the <b>Workspace</b> 
which are not shown on the screen.  If this isn't sufficient to resolve 
your problem, you can go on to adjust the font size and the font itself, 
as below.
</blockquote>

<p>
<b>About a possible problem with the 'font' and Sound Loom, discovered on some 
machines.</b><br>
The <i>Sound Loom</i> uses the font 'Tahoma' which is supplied when (a 
reasonably recent [i.e. post 1997??] version of) 'Word' is packaged with Windows. 
If the <i>Sound Loom</i> user does not have this font [e.g. doesn't use 'Word' or has a 
very old version of 'Word'], <i>Sound Loom</i> defaults automatically to a font which is 
too large for one or two of the button displays, and these are therefore not 
readable.  The answer to this is to add how to alter the font to the installation 
instructions, as below.
</p>

<p>
If you have a problem with reading any of the <i>Sound Loom</i> buttons, this is most 
probably caused by your computer system not supporting the'Tahoma' font, the 
default font of the <i>Sound Loom</i>.  To fix this problem, you should install the 
font 'Arial' instead.'Arial' is a small sans-serif font which is readable on 
all <i>Sound Loom</i> buttons and menus. To do this, proceed as follows...
</p>

<ol>
<li>On the <b>Workspace</b>, click the mouse over the <b>'Redesign Soundloom'</b> checkbox 
(top of centre panel).  The checkbox should now have a tick in it.</li>

<li>Close down the <i>Sound Loom</i> and <b>restart</b> it.</li>

<li>The <i>Sound Loom</i> will now start up by displaying the <b>Redesign Page</b>.</li>

<li>On the right of this page, in the font panel, you will see a list of 
available fonts.  You can move up and down this list using the small 
scrollbar on the right of the font panel. <b>Find the font named 'Arial' and 
select it by clicking on it with the mouse</b>.</li>

<li>On the left of the page, under the heading 'STANDARD FEATURES' the first 
listed item is 'Font'.  With the mouse, click on the <b>'SET'</b> button to the 
right of the word 'Font'.</li>

<li>Now click on the <b>'Keep New Design'</b> button (on the right at the 
very top of the page) to exit the <b>Redesign Page</b>, saving this new font 
setting.</li>

<li>After the 'New User Help' page, the <b>Workspace</b> will now appear, and 
you should find that all texts are written in the font 'Arial'.  These 
should be clearly legible on all buttons and menus.</li>

<li>You can now <b>unmark</b> the 'Redesign Soundloom' checkbutton, by 
clicking on it with the mouse. The tick should disappear from the check 
box.</li>

<li>Close down the <i>Sound Loom</i> in the normal way (End Session) to 
ensure your new default setting is saved.</li>

<li>From now on, the <i>Sound Loom</i> will use the font' Arial'.</li>
</ol>
