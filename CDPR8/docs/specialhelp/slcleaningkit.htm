<H3><U>Introduction</U></H3>

<P>The 'Cleaning Kit' was originally developed to clean up vocal recordings 
made in noisy environments.<BR><BR>Typical sources of noise might be ... 
  <UL>
  <LI><B>Relatively Constant</B> (e.g. extractor fan or air-conditioning 
hum)<BR>
  <LI><B>Sustained but Changing</B> (e.g. a passing motor vehicle)<BR>
  <LI><B>Intermittent</B> (creaks of furniture, clothing noise)<BR>
  <LI><B>Intermittent but Complex</B> (e.g. other people talking)<BR></LI>
  </UL>
The Cleaning Kit uses some existing and some new CDP programs to tackle all 
of these situations. However, it is not possible to deal with all possible noise 
intrusions.<BR>At present, the Cleaning Kit handles only mono files. To clean 
stereo or multichannel files you will need to split the source into its 
constituent channels and clean each channel separately. 
<P></P>

<H3><U>The Cleaning Kit Framework</U></H3>

The Main Cleaning Kit window presents 
  <UL>
  <LI><B>A list of <A href="#CKTOOLS">Cleaning Tools</B></A> to apply to 
  your source.<BR><BR>
  <LI><B>A soundfiles window</B> for listing soundfiles, where your file to be 
  cleaned will appear.<BR><BR>Typically, cleaning a source will involved several 
  passes. As you proceed, the soundfiles generated at each cleaning stage will 
  be listed in the window. You can select (by clicking on a file in the window) 
  which of these sounds you wish to clean (e.g. you can go back to the output of 
  the penultiamte cleaning procedure, if the last cleaning operation proved 
  unsatisfactory).<BR>The window defaults to chosing the output of the last 
  cleaning operation.<BR><BR>
  <LI><B>An output filename box</B>, where you can choose a name for the final, 
  completely cleaned sound.<BR><BR>Often you will wish to overwrite the original 
  source, so there is a button to put the name of the source file in the 
  output-filename box.<BR></LI>
  </UL>

<H3><U><A name=CKTOOLS>The Cleaning Kit Tools and their Uses</A></U>
</H3>
There are currently 13 options for cleaning sources.<BR>You can call any one of these 
options br pressing the button adjacent to its name.<BR>When a tool is called, a 
new window will appear and you will be asked to enter relevant parameters for 
that Cleaning process.<BR><BR>

The 13 Cleaning options are 
<OL>
  <LI><B>Clean General Noise</B><BR><BR>This would typically be used to 
  <B>remove constant background sounds</B> like air-conditioning or 
  extractor-fan hum.<BR><BR>

  <LI><B>Gate out Bad Signal</B><BR><BR>This replaces unwanted sound by silence 
  of the same duration. This can be used, for example<BR><BR>

    <UL>
    <LI>To remove intakes of breath, or unwanted glossalalia. 
    <LI>To remove any residual 'flutterings' from the <B>Clean General Noise</B> 
    process. 
    <LI>To remove low level, but complex, background sounds, like speech, where 
    the principal source pauses (even momentarily). Particularly useful in 
    situations where the foreground sound you want is loud enough to mask the 
    background sounds most of the time, except when it pauses.<BR><BR></LI>
    </UL>
  <LI><B>Cut away Bad Signal</B><BR><BR>This can be used, for example<BR><BR>

    <UL>
    <LI>To remove loud, short, intrusive sounds (from door-slams to clicks and 
    clinks). 
    <LI>To remove hesitations.<BR><BR></LI>
    </UL>
  <LI><B>Reinsert Original Signal</B><BR><BR>

  <LI><B>Remove Pitch in Signal</B><BR><BR>This is a spectral subtraction 
  process, and can be used, for example<BR><BR>

    <UL>
    <LI>To remove clearly pitched electronic tones from gadgets used in the 
    environment. 
    <LI>To remove residual pitches left behind by the <B>Subtract Spectrum</B> 
    or <B>Clean General Noise</B> options. 
    <LI>To remove an interrupting voice, where both the principal speaker, and 
    the interrupting speaker, are speaking vowels, and each has a clear but 
    different pitch. This sometimes works perfectly and at other times fails 
    completely!<BR><BR></LI>
    </UL>

  <LI><B>Remove Sound under Sibilant</B><BR><BR>This is a filtering process, and 
  can be used to remove intrusive sounds where the foreground speaker is using a 
  sibilant<BR>Typical intrusions might be<BR><BR>

    <UL>
    <LI>the hum of passing traffic. 
    <LI>a 2nd voice using a vowel.<BR><BR></LI>
    </UL>

  <LI><B>Remove Noise Above Signal</B><BR><BR>This is a filtering process, and 
  can be used to remove noise type intrusions<BR>Typical intrusions might 
  be<BR><BR>

    <UL>
    <LI>clothing noise. 
    <LI>a 2nd voice using a sibilant.<BR><BR></LI>
    </UL>
  This often causes some degradation of the principal source at the point where 
  the filtering is done.<BR>It is usually better to use spectral subtraction if 
  this is possible at the particular time in the source.<BR><BR>

  <LI><B>Low Frequency Problem</B><BR><BR>This is a filtering process, and can 
  be used to remove low frequency intrusions<BR><BR>Typical intrusions might be 
    <UL>
    <LI>Footfalls or falling objects on carpeted floors. 
    <LI>physical knocks on microphones or stands. 
    <LI>wind/breath noise on a microphone.<BR><BR></LI>
    </UL>

  <LI><B>Subtract Spectrum</B><BR><BR>This is typically useful where a noise 
  intrusion begins, ends, or overlays a time where the foreground source is 
  silent, but then continues over the foreground source. You are asked to 
  specify the place where the intrusion is <B>not</B> overlaying the principal 
  source as well as the whole area to be cleaned. The process works by 
  subtracting the former from the latter. It can sometimes be used instead of 
  filtering or gating.<BR><BR>

  <LI><B>Graft segment Elsewhere</B><BR><BR>This is a last resort process, where 
  nothing can be done to remove a noise intrusion. It allows you, for example, 
  to cut a sliver of a sybillant from one part of the recording, and use that to 
  replace a noise-intruded sibilant elsewhere.<BR><BR>

  <LI><B>Insert Silence</B><BR><BR>Cutting away bad signal can sometimes result 
  in unnatural speech (or other) rhythms. These can sometimes be mitigated by 
  inserting an appropriate durations of silence.<BR><BR>

  <LI><B>Attenuate Level</B><BR><BR>This can be used, for example, to compensate 
  for the source's back and forth movement in front of the microphone.<BR><BR>
  <LI><B>Dovetail the Ends</B><BR><BR>This can be useful where a section of 
  recording has been cut from a longer source. For example, a single voice is 
  extracted from a conversation and the 2 speakers overlap at the boundary but, 
  to preserve the sense of the speech, the overlapped segment has to be 
  retained. Using other processes (pitch or sibilant removal, see above) may 
  still leave some residual unwanted signal. This can sometimes be hidden by 
  subtlely dovetailing the start (or end) of the recording.<BR>
