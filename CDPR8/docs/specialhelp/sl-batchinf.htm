Some tips on using the Sound Loom batchfile mechanism
</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>
<ol>

<p>
<li>Place your batchfile on the <b>Workspace</b> (using Windows Explorer).<br>
OR use <b>Find directory</b> to select one from elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
<li>Click on <b>List batchfiles</b> and click on one with the mouse to <b>select</b> 
it from among the batchfiles listed for that directory.
</p>

<p>
<li>Click on <b>Load file</b> to load its contents into the batchfile 
mechanism.  If you try to run without doing this, the message 'No batchfile data 
given' appears.
</p>

<p>
<li>Double-check <b>where</b> the source file to process is located, according to the 
batchfile.  <b>If no path is given, it must be on the Workspace.</b>
	<blockquote>
	It can be elsewhere, but then the full path to it must be given, with 
	*forward-slashes*, not back-slashes (because of the way TCL works).   If 
	it cannot find the source, you may see a message reading 'Error: cannot 
	find channel named "0"'.
	</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
<li>You can <b>edit and save</b> the batchfile (no .bat extension in the 
name of the file when you save it).  The <b>Syntax</b> button provides a quick reference 
for command line usage.  Full information is in the CDP HTML Reference documentation 
accessed via <i>ccdpndex.htm</i>, for which it is useful to have a shortcut on 
your Desktop.
</p>

<p>
<li>Click on <b>Run</b> to run the batch file.  Note the display of which line it 
is processing.  Click on OK when finished.
</p>

<p>
<li>The output soundfile(s) is/are placed on the Workspace.
</p>

</ol>
