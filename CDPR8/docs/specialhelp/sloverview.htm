<H2 style="COLOR: darkmagenta" align=center>The Sound Loom &#150; An 
Overview</h2><br /><br />

<H2 style="COLOR: darkmagenta" align=center>What is The Sound Loom ?</H2>
<P>The Sound Loom is an <B>integrated graphic interface</B> to the CDP 
sound-processing software, <B>a comprehensive collection of over 500 instruments 
for <A href="http://www.trevorwishart.co.uk/transformation.html">sound 
transformation</A> </B>developed as practical working tools by composers over 
many years, available from the <A 
href="http://www.composersdesktop.com">Composers' Desktop 
Project</A>.<BR>There is also a <I>CDP Users' Discussion Group</I>. </P>
<P>The <I>Sound Loom</I> + <I>CDP software</I> is a <B>powerful toolbox for 
composers</B>, not a performance instrument. Using it, you can specify the 
parameters of any process to any degree of time-varying detail, detail you may 
have composed or have extracted from some other complex sound-event. You cannot, 
however, alter these parameters <I>while the process is running</I>. </P>
<P>In compensation, the system offers almost any conceivable process for 
transforming sounds and sound-data (the data might be loudness envelopes, 
pitch-tracking information, spectral analysis data, filter specifications etc.) 
all running in a <B>unified, intelligent environment</B>. </P>
<H2 style="COLOR: darkmagenta" align=center>The CDP instruments</H2>
<P>The <I>CDP</I> instruments fall into four broad categories.... 
<UL>
  <LI><B>Transforming the waveform of the sound</B> e.g. 
  <UL>
    <LI>extracting and transforming the loudness contour. 
    <LI>various time-variable banks of filters. 
    <LI>different types of 'waveset' distortion. </LI></UL>
  <LI><B>Segmenting the sound, and reassembling segments</B> e.g. 
  <UL>
    <LI>'harmonizer' type time-stretch or pitch-shift. 
    <LI>sound-shredding. 
    <LI>reverberation. 
    <LI>regular, to random, brassage - from spectral modification to event-scale 
    montage (similar to <I>granular synthesis</I>). </LI></UL>
  <LI><B>Transforming the time-varying spectrum of the sound</B> e.g. 
  <UL>
    <LI>spectral tracing. 
    <LI>pitch and formant extraction and manipulation. 
    <LI>morphing from one sound to another. </LI></UL>
  <LI><B>Building new events from the whole sound</B> e.g. 
  <UL>
    <LI>naturalistic iteration. 
    <LI>multi-dimensional time-varying texture generation (also known as 
    <I>granular synthesis</I>). 
    <LI>mixing, e.g. with attack synchronisation. </LI></UL></LI></UL>
<P></P>
<P>
<H2 style="COLOR: darkmagenta" align=center>The <I>Sound Loom</I> 
environment</H2>
<P></P>
<P>The <I>Sound Loom</I> offers an intelligent working interface to all of these 
processes. On the <I>workspace</I> page, you can load the source sounds or data 
files you wish to work with. The <I>Sound Loom</I> keeps track of the properties 
of these files, and knows automatically which CDP processes are appropriate to 
any (list of) file(s) you choose to process and what parameter types (fixed 
values, time-varying values, filter-data etc.) and parameter ranges are 
appropriate to use in each case. </P>
<P>Every page of the <I>Sound Loom</I> comes with built in <B>Help</B> 
information, and there is a <B>New User Help</B> facility which can be turned 
off once you are familiar with the <I>Sound Loom</I>. The <I>Sound Loom Process 
Page</I> holds brief descriptions of each CDP process, and the parameter 
requirements of each process are documented from an <B>Information</B> button 
which appears when you call the that process. In addition, the <B>Which?</B> 
button allows you to query the <I>Sound Loom</I> to find out what processes 
might be appropriate to achieve a desired result (e.g. time-stretching, 
pitch-extraction etc.). </P>
<P>In addition, the <I>Sound Loom</I> interface has powerful facilities for 
creating and manipulating data (e.g. time-varying parameters, filter 
specifications, mix sequences etc.)... 
<UL>
  <LI>a <B>Table Editor</B> with hundreds of automatic processes for generating 
  or transforming data files. 
  <LI>a <B>Music Calculator</B> making conversions between various musical and 
  technical units. 
  <LI>a <B>Reference Store</B> where important values can be held during and 
  between sessions. </LI></UL>
<P></P>
<P>and for processing sounds in bulk... 
<UL>
  <LI><B>Bulk Process</B> allows you to apply the same process to a whole list 
  of sounds without having to enter each sound separately. 
  <LI><B>Batch Processing</B> allows several different processes to be 
  remembered and rerun, <I>all at once</I>, at a later time. Powerful editing 
  facilities allow new input sounds to be substituted, or parameters to be 
  changed in a systematic way. </LI></UL>
<P></P>
<P>The <I>Sound Loom</I> also allows you to.... 
<UL>
  <LI><B>remember favourite processes</B> (to recall at a single button press) 
  <LI><B>remember patches</B> (particular sets of parameters used for a 
  particular process, all recalled at a single button press) 
  <LI><B>build hyper-instruments</B>, i.e. a <I>sequence</I> of existing CDP 
  processes, combined into a new, named, super-process with its own parameter 
  set. Once created, this can be run just like a single CDP process. 
  <LI><B>organise your sounds in musically appropriate 'virtual directories'</B> 
  : you can store the same sound in any number of named <I>B-Lists</I> e.g. 
  'Introduction', 'Section3a', 'Coda' etc and load an entire virtual directory 
  to the workspace, to work on a specific section of a musical piece. 
  <LI><B>sketch your compositional ideas</B>, arranging and rearranging sounds 
  (and comments) on a <I>Sketch Score</I> on which you can also run different 
  types of test mixes, before deciding on a final running order.<BR><BR>all of 
  which are permanently stored between sessions; and.....<BR><BR>
  <LI><B>experiment with harmonies</B>, either in standard (tempered) tuning, or 
  using any frequencies you want. 
  <LI><B>experiment with sound interpolation</B>, to get the best results for 
  changing one sound gradually into another. </LI></UL>
<P></P>
<P>The Sound Loom also.... </P>
<P>
<UL>
  <LI><B>Remembers where you are at the end of a session</B>, restoring that 
  situation at the start of the next. 
  <LI><B>Maintains a record of activities</B> ( a log), allowing any previous 
  action (from the current or any previous session) to be recalled, and allows 
  intelligent reconstruction where a sound or data file has been renamed or 
  deleted in the interim. 
  <LI>Uses a very simple data storage strategy and is therefore <B>very 
  robust</B>: a system hang or crash will leave all data intact except, perhaps, 
  for the very last action you were performing. No previous data, or input 
  sound, or output sound, or system configuration, or patch, or hyper-instrument 
  or activity-log will be lost. </LI></UL>
<P></P>
<H2 style="COLOR: darkmagenta" align=center>Reporting Faults</H2>
<P>You can report faults to the CDP, but fault reports must be specific i.e. 
please report.... 
<OL>
  <LI>which version of the software you are running. 
  <LI>the exact sequence of operations leading up to the fault (please try to 
  reproduce the fault - if it is not reproducible, it may be due to factors 
  outside the <I>Sound Loom</I> or CDP's control). 
  <LI>the type and size of all sound, analysis (or other binary) files being 
  used with the process that fails. 
  <LI>the contents of any (text) data files being used with the process. 
  <LI>The exact fault message received - this may be 
  <UL>
    <LI>a <I>Sound Loom</I> message. 
    <LI>a TK/TCL message, which shows up in a window which allows the fault to 
    be traced - please follow the trace, and report the complete contents of the 
    TK/TCL fault report window. 
    <LI>a message from you operating system, e.g. reporting a software crash.</LI>
  </UL>
  </LI>
</OL>

<P></P>
<P>If you have <I>operational</I> problems, please consult other users first.
