CDP GUIDE v.2 (updated for CDP Release 8)
===========================================

This guide is a series of html dcocuments aimed at helping beginners (and others) find their way around the CDP suite. The Reference Documentation is based around function groups originally designed for Release 4.5 in 2001. Since then, many newer functions and variants have been added to the groups, with new program names. This makes it difficult to relate the various programs to each other. 

The series has five documents covering: 
1. SOUNDFILE PROCESSES (cdpsnd.html), 
2. SPECTRAL PROCESSES (cdpspect.html), 
3. PITCH-DATA (cdppitch.html, 
4. EDIT & MIX (cdpedit.html), and 
5. OTHER: Synth, Info, Utils etc. (cdpother.html), 
plus an INDEX page (cdpguide.html). 

Every documented CDP function is mentioned, with Reference Documentation page. 

The classification is based on Soundshaper's menu structure and the documents have been adapted from an existing html set which aimed to catalogue the contents of these menus. The descriptions are slightly longer than the one-liners in the Reference Docs, but generally do not describe parameters.

The aim is to point users to the Reference Docs, where they can digest the details for themselves.  The descriptions do not necessarily reflect the views of CDP, and they may contain inaccuracies - but they are not set in stone and users are welcome to point out errors and suggest re-wordings.

The collection is housed in a subfolder called "guide" - it is intended that this should reside in parallel with the Reference Docs' html folder (i.e. on the same level) -- all the hyperlinks make this assumption. The Documentation menus have a link to cdpguide.html.  A printable version in PDF format is also provided; this does not have active hyperlinks.

Inaccuracies and suggestions for improvement should be sent to me at ensemble-software@hotmail.com.
