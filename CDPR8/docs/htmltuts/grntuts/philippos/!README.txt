• Please copy all files in the folder "files" to another folder (e.g. TUTORIAL), which will be your working directory for the tutorial.
• In GrainMill, select the other folder as your working directory.

Then:  
• Go to 'Open Soundfile' in GrainMill's FILE menu and select the source sound "horn.wav".
• Load one .grn file (e.g wildphrase.grn) and press the MAKE IT button at the right bottom of the window.
• Wait for processing to take place. You now have the first sound.
• SAVE AS the resulting soundfile, using the name as in the tutorial.

Repeat the last four steps for each of the .grn files in the folder.
