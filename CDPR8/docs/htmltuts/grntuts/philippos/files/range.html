<H3>Activating a <EM>range</EM></H3>
<P>
In general, a range is activated by:<BR>
<UL>
	<LI>Clicking on the <STRONG>range</STRONG> box below the parameter name (e.g PITCH).
	This puts two data entry boxes on the screen, for upper and lower limits.

	<LI>The boxes on the left are for single value upper and lower limits. 

	<LI>The boxes on the right of the screen are for time-varying breakpoint 
	files.  Activate them by clicking on the box to the left of the upper or 
	lower data entry box.

	<LI>Fill in a file name or click on <EM>Br..</EM> to browse through your files 
	if you have already created a breakpoint file. 
	
	<LI> If you have not, click on <EM>E</EM> to create one with the graphic breakpoint
	editor. Save your new file and select it as above.
</UL>

<P>
The relevant parameter then changes randomly between the upper and lower limits 
defined in this way.
