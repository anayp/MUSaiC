<h2>
Introduction
</h2>

<p><b>CMD.exe</b> is a Windows program which provides a <b>command 
line interface</b> to the rest of the system.  This program contains a 
number of in-built commands such as <b>dir</b>, <b>del</b>, <b>copy</b> etc.  
One can also use it to type in commands which run other programs, such as the 
command line programs of the CDP System. 
The program is normally found in C:\Windows\System32 and if you are going to use it frequently, a desktop shortcut is recommended.

</p>

<p>One of the basic things to understand about this interface is that it 
needs to know, as it were, <i>where it is</i>., i.e., which part of the 
hard drive it is accessing and onto which it is going to place new or 
altered files.  The key concept is that of <b>current directory</b>.  This 
is where it is <i>now</i>.  Let's look at some terminology:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><b>top level</b> <dd>this refers to the entire partition of a hard 
disk, conventionally named <b>c:</b>, <b>d:</b>. etc.  When this is where 
the command prompt is, the command line of the prompt will read:  
<b>c:\&gt;</b>  In this notation, the <b>c:</b> means which partition, 
the '<b>\</b>' is a level marker and the '<b>&gt;</b>' is pointing to 
the active cursor (should be flashing).  All commands for this command 
interface are placed adjacent to this '&gt;', without a space.  When it 
says 'c:\' you know it's the top level because there's nothing to the left 
of the '\' except the 'c:'.

<dt><b>directory</b> <dd>this is a user-defined section of the hard 
drive.  It's a logical section, meaning that the information may be 
physically scattered, but linked in software under this one label.  These 
are like the drawers of a filing cabinet and are used in the same way:  to 
group information in some sensible way.

<dt><b>sub-directory</b> <dd>this is a user-defined directory inside 
another directory, such as ye olde manilla folders which we place inside 
the drawers of our filing cabinet.

<dt><b>files</b> <dd>and what do we have inside the drawers or manilla 
folders?  Files, usually documents.  On the computer, these can be <i>text 
files</i> of various kinds such as plain ascii text or the text created by 
a word processor (which has extra, hidden formatting instructions);  the 
files can also be <i>executable programs</i>, i.e., sets of instructions to 
do something.  There is a special kind of file called a <i>batch file</i>;  
these have the extension '.bat' on Windows systems, and '.sh' on 
MAC and Linux conputers.  They are text files which can contain commands (i.e., a 
list of command lines) and will execute all the commands in the list 
when run.  The batch file is run by entering its name without the extension 
&#150; except on the MAC, where the extension is used.

<dt><b>current directory</b> <dd>this is literally where you are at any 
given time, i.e., the directory which is currently active.  All new files 
will automatically be placed here <i>unless explicitly told to do 
otherwise</i>.  The computer can access all files in the current directory 
without any further instructions about where it is.  But, and this is 
vitally important, <i>it cannot access any files outside of the current 
directory without being told where they are</i>.

<dt><b>path</b>	<dd>'path' is the mechanism by which the computer is told 
where something is.  This can be done explicitly by typing this information 
on the command line.  For example, the command:<br>
<b>c:\hereiam\&gt;copy ..\somewhereelse\myfile.txt</b><br>
will copy 'myfile.txt' from the directory 'somewhereelse' to the current 
directory 'hereiam'.  Why the two dots?  To go there and get this file, 
the computer had to go <i>out of </i>'hereiam' (back up one level) and 
then across to 'somewhereelse'.  The '..\' notation is how the computer 
does this.  It is called 'going up a level'.  In this case, both of these 
directories are directly under c:, the top level.  The path to executable 
programs, <i>and only to<b> executable</b> <b>programs</i></b> can be set 
to work automatically by setting the <b>path</b> command in Control Panel 
(see <a href="cmas1cdp.htm#PATH"><b>RUNNING THE CDP SYSTEM &#150 Setting the Path</b></a>) 
</dl>

<h2>
Files on the 'top level'
</h2>

<p>Files can be placed on the top level of a partition.  If this is the 
case, they are simply on e.g. <b>c:\</b> and not within a directory or 
sub-directory.  To do something with a text file, you have to use a 
command such as <b>copy</b> or <b>del</b>(ete) or <b>type</b> and a 
command to do this would look like this:

<p><b>c:\&gt;type afile.txt</b>

<p><b>NB1:  It is assumed that you will press the ENTER key in order to 
run the command you've just put on the command line.</b>

<p><b>NB2:  there is no space after the '\', but there is a space after the 
command 'type';  otherwise it would appear that the command were 
'typeafile.txt', which it wouldn't recognise, resulting in the message 
'bad command or filename'.</b>

<p>To do something with an executable file, i.e. a program or batch file, 
you just enter its name on the command prompt, omitting its extension 
'.exe' or .bat'.  This would look like this:

<p><b>c:\&gt;aprogram</b>

<p><b></b>The command <b>dir</b> lists all the files in the current 
directory, giving name, size, date and time it was saved, etc.

<p><font size=4><b>To go 'down' directory levels</b></font>

<p>This procedure uses the command <b>cd</b>, i.e., 'change 
directory' or, 'make the following the new current directory'.  I could 
create a directory called 'drawer1' with the command <b>md</b> thus:

<p><b>c:\&gt;md drawer1</b>

<p><b></b>This places a directory inside the 'top level' of drive c:.  
<i>I can then go there with the command <b>cd</i></b> thus:

<p><b>c:\&gt;cd drawer1</b>

<p>Now, when I next see the Command Prompt, it will show:

<p><b>c:\drawer1&gt;</b>

<p>Note that the '<b>&gt;</b>' is now to the right of 'drawer1', showing 
that the <b>path</b> now includes 'drawer1'.  This means that 'drawer1' is 
the current directory, and this is where you are now. <br> 
<b>The computer will not find executable programs or any other files outside of this 
directory unless a path has been set or it is explicitly told where that file is.</b>

<p>To move to a<b> sub-directory</b>, such as ye olde manilla folder inside 
the drawer, you just <i>continue the process</i>.  Thus, to move from 
'drawer1 to 'manilla1' inside the drawer, you will enter:

<p><b>c:\drawer1&gt;cd manilla1</b>

<p><b></b>and now the command prompt will look like this:

<p><b>c:\drawer1\manilla1&gt;</b>

<p><b></b>To go 'up' directory levels

<p>Going back up uses the notation '<b>..</b>' or, more explicitly, 
'<b>..\</b>'.  One set of the two dots moves you out of one directory back 
'up' to the next adjacent higher level, i.e., the directory your current 
directory is inside of.  'Manilla1' is inside 'drawer1'.  So to move out 
of 'manilla1' and up into 'drawer1', you enter:

<p><b>c:\drawer1\manilla1&gt;cd ..\</b>

<p>and the command prompt will now look like this:

<p><b>c:\drawer1&gt;</b>

<p>So you see what's happened.  Similarly, moving back up to the top level 
can be done like this:

<p><b>c:\drawer1&gt;cd ..</b>

<p>and the command prompt will say:

<p><b>c:\&gt;</b>

<p>Finally, this move from a sub-directory to the top level (two levels up) 
can be done in one step:

<p><b>c:\drawer1\manilla1&gt;cd ..\..</b>

<p>Etc.  This procedure works for any number of levels of 'nested' 
directories:  up to whatever the system can handle.  (Having too many 
levels of nesting can become both confusing and tedious.)

<h2>
Setting the path with a batch file
</h2>

<p>The normal thing to do is to add the Path to the CDP programs (executables) to the PC system path, found under:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Control Panel &gt System (Properties) &gt Advanced (or Advanced System Properties) &gt Environment Variables</b>
</p><p>
In the LOWER window, select the Path line and click Edit. Put a semi-colon (';') after the last entry and then add the CDP programs path. This should be: <b>[drive-letter]:\cdpr7\_cdp\_cdprogs</b>
</p><p>

The computer will now be able to access any <b>.exe</b> <i>from 
anywhere</i>, i.e., from whatever directory is the current one.  This 
is because this <b>path</b> command instructs the computer to search the paths in turn to find the <b>.exe</b> being 
invoked.
</p><p>

You can also set a local, customised <b>path</b> within your current 
directory.  Just write the path you want into a <b>.bat</b> file of any 
name (I use <i>ae.bat</i>) and run the batch file:  enter the 'ae' on the 
command line with or without the '.bat' extension and press the ENTER key.
</p>

<h2>What can the command line interpreter do? </h2>

<p>Enter the command <b>help</b> and you will be shown a list of all 
available commands.  Note that you will probably be using only a handful 
of these! For specific help on a command, type <b>help</b> followed by the command name, 
for example <b>help dir</b>.
