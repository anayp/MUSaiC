<h2 id="INTRO">Introduction</h2>

<p>
The CDP System can be thought of as if it were one single program.  
Since Release 4, the functions available have been grouped into a number of 
'families' of processes, most of which are run within one executable program.
</p>

<p>
This document uses the 'keyhole' idea in an effort to make an initial 
contact with the CDP System a little more comprehensible.  It focuses on 
a selection of the many functions available, with emphasis on the most 
basic and most used functions, but also goes on to outline the significance 
of some of the more advanced processes.

<dl>
<dt><a href="../../html/csysutil.htm#DIRSF"><b>DIRSF</b></a> 
<dd>to list all the sound and analysis files in the current 
directory, with header information
<br /><br />

<dt><a href="../../html/cgrohous.htm#COPY"><b>HOUSEKEEP COPY </b></a>
<dd>to make a copy of a soundfile, sometimes converting 
it to a different format in the process.
<br /><br />

<dt><a href="../../html/cgroinfo.htm#LEN"><b>SNDINFO LEN</b></a> 
<dd>to quickly find out the duration (length) of a 
soundfile, to several decimal points accuracy
<br /><br />

<dt><a href="../../html/cgrohous.htm#CHANS"><b>HOUSEKEEP CHANS</b></a> 
<dd>to convert from stereo to mono, or v.vs.  Quite a 
few programs will only operate on mono soundfiles, so this is likely to be 
used frequently.  On the whole, don't move to stereo unless it is really 
essential to do so.
<br /><br />

<dt><a href="../../html/cgrohous.htm#CHANS"><b>HOUSEKEEP CHANS</b></a> &#47; 
<a href="../../html/cgromixr.htm#INTERLEAVE"><b>SUBMIX INTERLEAVE</b></a> &#47; 
<a href="../../html/cgromody.htm#SPACE"><b>MODIFY SPACE</b></a> 
<dd>HOUSEKEEP CHANS is often used to separate out a stereo soundfile into its two component 
channels.  Each of these becomes a different mono soundfile.  Thus they can 
be processed individually, and then combined again to create a stereo 
soundfile with SUBMIX INTERLEAVE.  HOUSEKEEP CHANS can also zero the data 
in one channel while leaving it as a stereo soundfile.  SUBMIX SPACE can 
reverse the position of the two channels: Left and Right are swapped.
<br /><br />

<dt><a href="../../html/cgroinfo.htm#MAXSAMP"><b>SNDINFO MAXSAMP</b></a> &#47; 
<a href="../../html/cgromody.htm#LOUDNESS"><b>MODIFY LOUDNESS</b></a> 
<dd>SNDINFO MAXSAMP is used to gather information about the amplitude levels of a soundfile and 
recommend a <i>gain</i> factor which would 'normalise' it (bring it to 
full amplitude).  MODIFY LOUDNESS is then used to apply that <i>gain</i> 
factor to a soundfile.  MODIFY LOUDNESS can be used to increase or decrease 
the amplitude of a soundfile.  The gain factor is a multiplier.
<br /><br />

<dt><a href="../../html/cgrohous.htm#RESPEC"><b>HOUSEKEEP RESPEC</b></a> &#47; 
<a href="../../html/cgroinfo.htm#PROPS"><b>SNDINFO PROPS</b></a> 
<dd>HOUSEKEEP RESPEC can be 
used to change the sample rate of a soundfile, one of the 3 main items of 
information in a soundfile header.  The other is the number of channels and 
the sample type (shorts or floats).  This information about a particular 
soundfile can be seen with SNDINFO PROPS.  CDP soundfiles are 
usually shorts, and analysis files are floats, but support for floating point 
soundfiles is now coming in.  Sometimes, when sound is recorded from an 
external source, either as raw data or in a different format, it loses its 
previous header information.  HOUSEKEEP RESPEC can be used to reconstitute it.
<br /><br />

<dt><a href="../../html/cgroinfo.htm#UNITS"><b>SNDINFO UNITS</b></a>  
<dd>a very straightforward program which can be 
used to carry out a number of useful musical calculations, such as 
showing which frequency in Hz a certain MIDI note is.

<!-- ========================================================================= -->
<h2 id="KEY2">Keyhole View 2 &#150;  key editing functions</h2>

<p>
Very often, these facilities will be available as part of a graphic 
sound editor supplied with a sound card, especially the more professional 
models.  The graphic facilities are very useful when you want to isolate 
sections of a sound to cut out and paste elsewhere, especially because you 
can block out the section and audition it in order to hear if you have got 
it right or not.  These are most useful when the display is 'accurate to 
the sample', but this facility is frequently not available.  CDP's 
VIEWSF for PC Windows 95 systems is accurate to the sample.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, it can also be usedful to be able to cut a sound 
directly from the command line, such as when it doesn't matter very much 
where the cut is made:  you just want a bit of it for something.
</p>

<p>
<dl>
<dt><a href="../../html/cgroedit.htm#CUT"><b>SFEDIT CUT</b></a> 
<dd>does this, saving the cut portion as a separate soundfile.  The 
<i>-splice</i> flag sets the slope of the splice (in milliseconds);  values 
above 30 will very much soften the onset of the sound.  The CDP programs 
HOUSEKEEP EXTRACT, SFEDIT ZCUT, and SPEC CUT extend the 'cut' functionality:
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="../../html/cgrohous.htm#EXTRACT"><b>HOUSEKEEP EXTRACT</b></a> 
<dd>will cut according to <i>gate</i> and <i>threshold</i> 
specifications (this enables you to e.g. separate a number of recording 
'takes' all at once);
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  
<a href="../../html/cgroedit.htm#ZCUT"><b>SFEDIT ZCUT</b></a> 
<dd>divides up a soundfile according to its zero crossings;
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  
<a href="../../html/cspecedi.htm#CUT"><b>SPEC CUT</b></a>
<dd> enables you to cut out portions of an analysis 
file, useful, for example, when progressively stretching sound material:  
stretch several times, cut out a bit of the stretched analysis file, 
stretch that some more, etc.  This produces really stretched out material 
in situations when it isn't necessary to retain the whole of the original 
sound (which would get longer and longer!).
<br /><br />

<dt><a href="../../html/cgroedit.htm#JOIN"><b>SFEDIT JOIN</b></a> 
<dd>is used to link together a string of soundfiles.  Note that in 
this case the <i>outfile</i> name comes first.  It also has a <b>-w</b> 
flag with which the slope of the splice can be controlled.  SFEDIT JOIN run 
from a batchfile can be a powerful way to create a series soundfile 'tracks' 
&#150; note that you can splice in silence by making a silent soundfile 
with SYNTH SILENCE, or silence can be inserted into a soundfile with 
SFEDIT INSIL or in several places at once with SFEDIT MASKS.
<br /><br />

<dt><a href="../../html/cgromody.htm#SPACE"><b>MODIFY SPACE</b></a> 
<dd>uses a breakpoint textfile to define spatial position 
over time.  Note that when mixing soundfiles with SUBMIX MIX, any pan 
operations have to be done first.
<br /><br />

<dt><a href="../../html/cgromixr.htm#MIX"><b>SUBMIX MIX</b></a> 
<dd>will mix many soundfiles at once &#150; the Manual  
states a limit of 1000.  Sometimes you may want to mix 
more sounds than are available on  
graphic mix programs &#150; but watch out for amplitude overload; 
run <a href="../../html/cgromixr.htm#GETLEVEL"><b>SUBMIX GETLEVEL</b></a> 
first to check for overload. If overload is reported, use 
<a href="../../html/cgromixr.htm#ATTENUATE"><b>SUBMIX ATTENUATE</b></a>
to reduce the overall level of the mixfile.    
Alternatively, check the output level with 
<a href="../../html/cgroinfo.htm#MAXSAMP"><b>MAXSAMP</b></a> 
before playing the mixed sound.
</dl>
</p>

<p>
CDP's more advanced facilities associated with mixing include 
<a href="../../html/cgroinfo.htm#LENS"><b>SNDINFO LENS</b></a>,  
<a href="../../html/cgromixr.htm#SHUFFLE"><b>SUBMIX SHUFFLE</b></a>, 
<a href="../../html/cgromixr.htm#SPACEWARP"><b>SUBMIX SPACEWARP</b></a>, and 
<a href="../../html/cgromixr.htm#TIMEWARP"><b>SUBMIX TIMEWARP</b></a>.  

With <a href="../../html/cgroinfo.htm#LENS"><b>SNDINFO LENS</b></a> you can get the sum of the lengths of a list of soundfiles.  
With the SUBMIX functions, you can shuffle the data in a mixfile 
(<a href="../../html/cgromixr.htm#SHUFFLE"><b>SUBMIX SHUFFLE</b></a>), 
perform a number of panning operations over the various files in a mixfile 
(<a href="../../html/cgromixr.htm#SPACEWARP"><b>SUBMIX SPACEWARP</b></a>), 
or play with the timegaps between the sounds in a mixfile 
(<a href="../../html/cgromixr.htm#TIMEWARP"><b>SUBMIX TIMEWARP</b></a>).  
</p>

<p>
It is useful to sketch out a 'mix' on paper, showing when each 
soundfile starts along a time-grid, and how long they last 
(<a href="../../html/cgroinfo.htm#LEN"><b>SNDINFO LEN</b></a> 
is useful for that);  then you can see if and how much they overlap.
</p>

<p>
<dl>
In the Spectral Domain, you can effect a seamless mix with COMBINE MAX.  
<dt><a href="../../html/ccombine.htm#MAX"><b>COMBINE MAX</b></a> 
<dd>accepts two <i>or more</i> analysis files and it retains 
the one channel of all of them which is the loudest;  sometimes the 
result is a nice mix sounding very much like a
 
<a href="../../html/cgromixr.htm#MIX"><b>SUBMIX MIX</b></a> result, while at 
other times you get an amalgam of the inputs which can be very surprising:  
because of the omitted material.
<br /><br />

<dt><a href="../../html/ccombine.htm#INTERLEAVE"><b>COMBINE INTERLEAVE</b></a> 
<dd>doesn't really perform a mix, 
but it interleaves analysis files in user-definable groups of windows 
(e.g., 10 of one, then 10 of the other, etc.).

<h2 id="KEY3">Keyhole View 3 &#150; functions which are used frequently</h2>

<p>
I find myself using the next group of programs over and over, usually 
in order to distance the sound material from its recognisable origins.  
This makes it more 'plastic' and usable in a sonic context in which the 
associations of the original sound would get in the way.

<dl>
<dt><a href="../../html/cpvocman.htm#USAGEANAL"><b>PVOC ANAL</b></a> 
<dd>is used to turn a soundfile into an analysis file, and 

<dt>
<a href="../../html/cpvocman.htm#USAGESYNTH"><b>PVOC SYNTH</b></a> 
<dd>resynthesizes an analysis file back into a soundfile.
<br /><br />

<dt><a href="../../html/cgromody.htm#RADICAL"><b>MODIFY RADICAL 1 </b></a>(REVERSE) 
<dd>turns a sound around backwards, a useful first step 
in distancing it from its origins
<br /><br />

<dt><a href="../../html/cgromody.htm#SPEED"><b>MODIFY SPEED</b></a> 
<dd>basic transposition higher or lower can make a sound 
surprisingly different
<br /><br />

<dt><a href="../../html/cblur.htm#BLUR"><b>BLUR BLUR</b></a> 
<dd>smooths over analysis windows in groups of user-definable 
sizes.  With a breakpoint file, one can play with recognisability by 
increasing/decreasing the size of the groups.
<br /><br />

<dt><a href="../../html/chilite.htm#TRACE"><b>HILITE TRACE</b></a> 
<dd>by retaining only the specified number of loudest 
channels, a sound can be reduced to a mere 'trace' of the original.  Try 
a value of 5 spectral components and see what happens.
<br />
(Note also
<a href="../../html/chilite.htm#BLTR"><b>HILITE BLTR</b></a> 
which combines BLUR and TRACE within one function.)
<br /><br />

<dt><a href="../../html/cgromody.htm#RADICAL"><b>MODIFY RADICAL 5</b></a> 
<dd>this actually implements a form of ring-modulation
<br /><br />
</dl>

<h3>ENVELOPE FUNCTIONS</h3>
<dl>
<dt><a href="../../html/cgroenvl.htm#CREATE"><b>ENVEL CREATE</b></a> 
<dd>basic program for shaping an envelope &#150; uses a 
breakpoint file to specify <i>time / amplitude</i>.
<br>
</dl>
</p>

<p>
However, CDP programs go much further than this when it comes to handling 
envelopes, and this is one of the more powerful areas of the system.  
The following are key functions to get to know (and why):

<dl>

<dt><a href="../../html/"><b>ENVEL REPLACE</b></a> 
<dd>a straightforward but effective tool for replacing the existing envelope of soundfile with 
that of another sound.
<br /><br />

<dt><a href="../../html/cgroenvl.htm#EXTRACT"><b>ENVEL EXTRACT</b></a> &#47;  
<a href="../../html/cgroenvl.htm#IMPOSE"><b>ENVEL IMPOSE</b></a> 
<dd>extract an amplitude envelope 
from one soundfile and apply it to another soundfile, thereby producing 
a third, new, soundfile with the 'substance' of the second file and the 
'shape' of the first.
</p>

<p>
Once this operation is familiar, one can move on to some of the 
possible <i>actions</i> with which the envelope shape can be modified 
before creating the output.  The next three programs can alter an 
envelope shape in 15 different ways:

<dt><a href="../../html/cgroenvl.htm#WARP"><b>ENVEL WARP</b></a> &#47 ;  
<a href="../../html/cgroenvl.htm#REPLOT"><b>ENVEL REPLOT</b></a> &#47 ; 
<a href="../../html/cgroenvl.htm#RESHAPE"><b>ENVEL RESHAPE</b></a> 
<dd>these 'warp' the envelope of a soundfile, a text breakpoint file, and a 
binary envelope file respectively.
<br /><br />

<dt><a href="../../html/cformant.htm#VOCODE"><b>FORMANTS VOCODE</b></a> 
<dd>this time we're dealing with a 
<a href="../../html/glosstec.htm#SPECTRALENVELOPE"><b>spectral envelope</b></a>, 
meaning the time-varying amplitude of the (ever-changing) frequencies of 
the sound.  The timbral data of the sound onto which the new envelope is 
being placed is retained, while the formant groups of the new envelope are 
imposed onto it. This process is known as 'cross-synthesis. 
Compare this result with FORMANTS GET and FORMANTS PUT:

<dt><a href="../../html/cformant.htm#GET"><b>FORMANTS GET</b></a> &#47;  
<a href="../../html/cformant.htm#PUT"><b>FORMANTS PUT </b></a>
<dd>extract and impose a spectral envelope;  
here the timbral and formant character of the first sound 
modifies the second.
</dl>

<br />
<br />
</p>

<!-- ========================================================================= -->
<h2 id="KEY4">Keyhole View 4 &#150; a number of basic but interesting processes</h2>

<p>
You might want to try out the folllowing relatively straightforward 
processes:

<dl>
<dt><a href="../../html/cfocus.htm#EXAG"><b>FOCUS EXAG</b></a> 
<dd>the peaks and troughs of the spectral envelope are 
exaggerated, which increases the audibility of the higher timbres and of 
contrast throughout the sound
<br /><br />

<dt><a href="../../html/cfocus.htm#FOLD"><b>FOCUS FOLD</b></a> 
<dd>higher frequencies are 'folded' over (transposed) 
into a specified frequency range, thus concentrating the data in that area
<br /><br />

<dt><a href="../../html/cstretch.htm#TIME"><b>STRETCH TIME</b></a> 
<dd>stretching the spectrum with a <i>time stretch_factor</i> 
breakpoint file;  this is like the former PVOC's <b>pvoc -T</b> but with 
temporal control;  this is a very important way to bring out the inner 
potential of a sound
<br /><br />

<dt><a href="../../html/crepitch.htm#TRANSPOSE"><b>REPITCH TRANSPOSE</b></a> 
<dd>transpose a sound without changing its length (the 
same effect as PVOC's former <b>-P</b> flag)
<br /><br />

<dt><a href="../../html/cblur.htm#NOISE"><b>BLUR NOISE</b></a> 
<dd>by introducing a degree of noise, the original sound is 
enriched with frequency data;  when used in a time-varying way, this 
can be a way in which a sound can 'emerge' out of a haze of noise
</dl>
</p>

<p>
<dt>There are a few more options to deal with in the following programs:

<dl>
<dt><a href="../../html/chilite.htm#BAND"><b>HILITE BAND</b></a> 
<dd>this enables you to deal with specific frequency bands 
within the sound, altering either amplitude or frequency data
<br /><br />

<dt><a href="../../html/cblur.htm#SPREAD"><b>BLUR SPREAD</b></a> 
<dd>the peaks of the spectral envelope are 'spread', which 
alters the sound to a surprising degree
<br /><br />

<dt><a href="../../html/cpitch.htm#TUNE"><b>PITCH TUNE</b></a> 
<dd>this can be very useful when working towards some form of 
harmonic sonority, either for its own sake or to tie in with other harmonic 
material in the piece;  the chart in Pierce's <i>The Science of Musical 
Sound</i> is useful here to find out which (well-tempered) frequency 
matches a specific note on the keyboard.
  
<a href="../../html/cgroinfo.htm#UNITS"><b>SNDINFO UNITS</b></a> can also be 
used to convert directly from MIDI note to frequency value.
<br /><br />

<dt><a href="../../html/cgromody.htm#RADICAL"><b>MODIFY RADICAL 2</b></a> (SHRED) 
<dd>this function can go a long way towards 
turning a source sound into a completely different form of modulating 
sound material by shredding it to varying degrees
<br /><br />

<dt><a href="../../html/cgromody.htm#BRASSAGE"><b>MODIFY BRASSAGE</b></a> 
<dd>can be used simply to 'granulate' 
a sound, i.e., turn it into a series of separate 'grains' or 'pulses'.  This 
is done with a density value of 1.  Having done this, the resultant sound 
can be used as an input to the other GRAIN functions, which are fairly 
simple in their operation.  (You can still use the Release 3 programs 
BRASSAGE, SAUSAGE & WEDGE, which approach granulation in different ways.)
</dl>
</p>

<h3 id="DISTORT">DISTORT FUNCTIONS</h3>


<p>
The <a href="../../html/cdistort.htm"><b>DISTORT</b></a> 
suite of programs offers a wide variety of sound 
transformations.  They are simple to use and repay careful study &#150; 
certainly an area for detailed and step-by-step exploration.  They are 
all based on the concept of a pseudo-wavecycle, i.e., the various 
(usually differing) portions of waveform that lie between zero-crossing 
(where the amplitude envelope passes through zero on its way from positive 
to negative, and v.v.s).  Because these portions of waveform differ in 
length, a (more) non-periodic (non-regular) waveform results, and this is 
what introduces the distortion.  Each program handles these pseudo-wavecycles 
in a different way.  Aesthetically, bear in mind the importance of textured 
surfaces in painting and sculpture.  The same importance can apply to the 
audio image, and this suite offers many ways to create different types of 
audio 'surface'.  Also see Richard Dobson's discussion of these programs 
( <a href="../../html/cdistort.htm#RWDDIST"><b>here</b></a>).
</p>

<p>
<dl>
<dt><a href="../../html/cdistort.htm#REFORM"><b>DISTORT REFORM</b></a>

the troughed envelope and <i>differing time-varying cycle counts</i>), and 
then combining the two mono files back into a stereo file (SUBMIX 
INTERLEAVE).  Some marvelously fluid phasing effects can be achieved.
<br /><br />

<dt><a href="../../html/cdistort.htm#DIVIDE"><b>DISTORT DIVIDE</b></a>

this program with that of MODIFY RADICAL, Mode 1 (REVERSE)
<br /><br />

<dt><a href="../../html/cdistort.htm#SHUFFLE"><b>DISTORT SHUFFLE</b></a> 
<dd>this provides a way to control the degree of

<a href="../../html/cdistort.htm#DELETE"><b>DISTORT DELETE</b></a> 
<dd>another way to stretch out or compress a soundfile.
</dl>
</p>

<p>
<b>Filters</b> are a key part of any sound transformation package, 
analogue or digital.  In digital, their operation requires setting several 
parameters.  Probably most important to understand is 
   <a href="../../html/glosstec.htm#FILTER"><b>'Q'</b></a>, 
which is simply 
the degree of 'focus' on the specified frequency:  a low number yields 
least focus, and a high number yields most focus.

We now come to a selection of CDP programs which are more advanced in 
their operation and produce on the whole more 'textured' types of results.

<dl>
<dt><a href="../../html/cgroextd.htm#LOOP"><b>EXTEND LOOP</b></a>

samplers (joining beginning and end to make a continuous sound), though 
this can be done as well by making <i>step</i> = 0.  It is more 
frequently used to segment a soundfile:  the output consists of lengths 
of input taken at <i>step</i> intervals, which can be greater than 
or less than the loop <i>length</i>. A small step value can also time-stretch the sound.

<a href="../../html/cblur.htm#DRUNK"><b>BLUR DRUNK</b></a> 
<dd>these are very powerful programs 
by which you can produce an output which differs from the input by the 
degree to which you 'wander about' in the source soundfile
<br /><br />

<dt><a href="../../html/cgromody.htm#REVECHO"><b>MODIFY REVECHO</b></a>  
<dd>
a classic delay line creating a series of echoes, which may be in very close succession to create  resonance; 
the time-varying delay option can create "phasing" effects when mixed with the original.
The more recent <a href="../../html/cgromody.htm#NEWDELAY"><b>NEWDELAY</b></a> also has a time-variable delay. 
<!--
a little easier to handle than 
loops of tape going round the studio, but also more difficult to 
understand;  the time-varying facility in MODIFY REVECHO also adds a lot 
of scope.

<dt><a href="../../html/cgromody.htm#BRASSAGE"><b>MODIFY BRASSAGE</b></a> 
<dd>one of the most powerful of CDP's programs, this 
becomes 'granular synthesis' when the <i>grainsize</i> gets into the 
hundredths of a second (e.g., 0.05).  The point about the time-varying file 
options is that <i>each grain</i> is chosen randomly within the limits set.  
By changing pitch transpositions, spatial positions, and splice lengths, 
for example, the texturing of the output can be made very complex (i.e., 
interesting to listen to).  On PC Windows systems, this function 
is also available as the graphic program, 
<a href="../../html/cgrnmill.htm"><i><b>GrainMill</i></b></a>.
<br /><br />

<dt><a href="../../html//cgromody.htm#SAUSAGE"><b>MODIFY SAUSAGE</b></a> 
<dd>like MODIFY BRASSAGE, but working with two or more sources.  I've 
had a lot of fun with the pitch transposition options.  
<!-- See <i>A Sausage Tutorial</i>. --> 
(Cycling around a set of pitches was previously possible with the Release 3 SAUSAGE (now withdrawn),  but has been removed from this version.) 
<br /><br />

<dt><a href="../../html/cgromody.htm#SPEED"><b>MODIFY SPEED</b></a> 
<dd>this makes time-varying transposition (= glissando 
effects) possible, but with the added capacity to specify times as applying 
either to the <i>infile</i> or to the <i>outfile</i>.  It can also be 
used to accelerate a soundfile to reach a specified multiple of its 
original speed at a defined (goal)time.
<br /><br />

<dt><a href="../../html/cpitch.htm#TRANSP"><b>PITCH TRANSP</b></a> and 
<a href="../../html/cstrange.htm#SHIFT"><b>STRANGE SHIFT</b></a> 
<dd>will shift part of the spectrum 
up or down, harmonically with PITCH TRANSP (relative distances between 
partials preserved), or inharmonically with STRANGE SHIFT: the partials 
will tend to bunch if shifted up, or stretch if shifted down.

The next group are variously based on 
<a href="../../html/crepitch.htm#GETPITCH"><b>REPITCH GETPITCH</b></a>.  
The function 
dependencies here are somewhat involved, as the pitch and transposition 
data can interact in the most wonderfully flexible way.  The following 
diagram charts out the basic relationships:  The key program is 
REPITCH GETPITCH (for extracting pitch contours in a sound), because all the 
other programs variously depend on its output.

<dd>REPITCH GETPITCH can follow (as best it can) the pitch movement of a 
sound over time.  This pitch shape can then be combined with another using 
<a href="../../html/crepitch.htm#COMBINE"><b>REPITCH COMBINE</b></a> (binary data) or 
<a href="../../html/crepitch.htm#COMBINEB"><b>REPITCH COMBINEB</b></a> (breakpoint data) to move 
from one to the other, and the output of REPITCH COMBINE&#47;B can used as 
the transposition file for another sound (REPITCH TRANSPOSE and REPITCH TRANSPOSEF).  
REPITCH TRANSPOSEF seeks to retain the original spectral envelope.

<a href="../../html/cpitch.htm#ALTHARMS"><b>PITCH ALTHARMS</b></a> 
<dd>sometimes it is important to work with 
the (harmonic) pitch material of a sound as accurately as possible.  
SPEC BARE aids in this process by zeroing the non-harmonic partials.  
Various procedures such as those done by PITCH ALTHARMS , 
<a href="../../html/cstrange.htm#INVERT"><b>STRANGE INVERT</b></a> and 
<a href="../../html/cpitch.htm#OCTMOVE"><b>PITCH OCTMOVE</b></a> may be improved when using a more 'harmonic' input.  The same is possibly true of cross-synthesis with
