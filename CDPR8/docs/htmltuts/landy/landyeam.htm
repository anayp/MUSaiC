<blockquote>
<a name="WHY">The following text</a> consists of an introduction to 
sound transformations in general, followed by a discussion of the 
aesthetics of sound transformations in electroacoustic music in Part II.  
Part III shows why a categorization system of sound transformations 
does not have to be based on a similar system categorizing all sound 
sources and/or timbres (colour, tone quality).  In Part IV a number of 
categories for sound transformations is proposed and is accompanied by 
a couple of hints for future users.
</p>

<p>
During several months in 1991, I spent my sabbatical working on a 
long-postponed research project.  Essentially I was interested in 
learning more about the highly undocumented world of sound 
transformations within electroacoustic music.  (Most information 
in this area is of a specialized nature such as software manuals.)  
These transformations often turn out to be a powerful compositional device 
and are, according to many composers, a great challenge as well.
</p>

<p>
My specific interest was to investigate what has been called the 
'aesthetics of sound transformations'.  I also wanted to create a 
classification system for sound transformations in the electroacoustic 
context as again no one had treated this subject either.  It is hoped 
that through this article a start may be made towards the better 
comprehension of the potential of sound transformations as a 
compositional device.  Now completed, a second collaborative phase 
of this project will commence which calls for more technical, practical 
aspects of sound transformations to be tackled including the creation 
of user-friendly graphic software for phase vocoding and a new 
user's manual (for more information, see <a href="#FN9">footnote 9</a>).

<h3>
<a name="TMETA">A) What are</a> sound transformations?
</h3>

<p>
One of the many fascinating compositional possibilities among the 
musical extensions available in today's electroacoustic music is the 
ability to create timbral development from one basic sound-texture 
to another.  This can be achieved within the course of one 'tone' 
or within a musical gesture.  An early relatively well-known example of 
this can be heard in Jonathan Harvey's work <i>Mortuos Plango, Vivos 
Voco</i> (1980) in which the sound of a struck bell occasionally seems 
to melt into the singing voice of his son as if this were a normal 
timbral transition (CD &#150; Wergo WER 2025-2).  As will be shown 
below, this concept of timbral migration is by no means new.  It is 
the extent of potential metamorphosis and the enormous increase of 
potential timbres that are of greatest interest here.  Sound 
transformations may be defined as a timbral metamorphosis (i.e., from 
point 'A' seemingly naturally to point 'B') within one single sound 
event or sonorous gesture.  In the latter case this can either take 
place within a sound continuum or by way of a discrete sound's 
repetition being transformed into that of a second[, third, etc.] sound, 
again as 'naturally' as possible.
</p>

<p>
It should be mentioned immediately that there are several opinions 
concerning the borderline between a single sound's morphology and a 
sound transformation.  Think, for example, of the evolution of a 
sustained cello tone, growing from a somewhat dry timbre to a vibrato 
and so on.  The difference can be found in the fact that, from the 
listener's point of view, there should not be a perception of just 
one original sound source, the 'A', within any transformation. This 
implies that the subtle composer could in fact manipulate one sound 
source (therefore generating a morphology of that single source) and 
create what is presently defined as a sound transformation.  Even if 
this line of separation is mildly vague, most consciously created 
sound transformations can in fact be heard as such.<a href="#FN1">

<h3>
<a name="PREVIOUS">B) Is this</a> a new concept?
</h3>

<p>
As mentioned above, it is the hypothesis of this text that sound 
transformation potential has grown enormously with the coming of 
electroacoustic music.  Of course 'grown' is the key word here.  
Timbral metamorphosis is almost as old as music and knows a variety 
of forms within vocal and instrumental music historically as well 
as within contemporary styles.  As a matter of fact, since music has 
rarely been composed in what might be called block-structures, one 
might conjecture that timbral transformation has always been one of 
many basic elements of orchestration.  A small selection of timbral 
metamorphosis within non-electroacoustic music now 
follows.<a href="#FN2"><b><sup>2</sup></b></a>
</p>

<p>
The first example is not necessarily the earliest.  In John Taverner's 
Mass <i>The Western Wind</i>, non-notated gradual overlapping is said 
to take place between choral tuttis and solo voice passages so that a 
more dense choral texture seems to flow into or become a thinner solo 
texture and vice-versa.  This sense of taking over parts can also be 
found in various instrumental works of Schutz and Gabrieli.  Haydn was 
known to have an interest in instrumental exchanges as well.  One 
of his favorite transformations is to have a pitch played by one 
instrument before a cadence and then have it seemingly magically 
taken over by another one immediately afterwards, thus changing 
the timbral texture entirely.
</p>

<p>
These metamorphoses become more sophisticated with time, especially 
during the last two centuries.  Towards the end of Mahler's 'Abschied' 
from <i>Das Lied von der Erde</i> there is some wonderful timbral interplay 
including brass sonorities being born of string textures.  This might 
have inspired Berio, for example when he composed 'O King' (also part 
of his <i>Sinfonia</i>) which is a whole work centered on timbral 
metamorphosis.  Not only does sophistication increase with time; the 
quantity of metamorphosis-users also expands.  A historic climax can 
be found in the work of Ligeti, the uncrowned master of timbral 
metamorphosis.  He has spent most of his career developing techniques 
within this area.  His <i>Cello Concerto</i> and <i>Requiem</i> are but two 
excellent examples of his timbre transformational works.  To conclude, 
the step from timbral metamorphosis in instrumental and vocal music to 
sound transformations in the electroacoustic genre was inevitable.

<h3>
<a name="RELEVANCE">C) What is its particular relevance</a> within 
electroacoustic music?
</h3>

<p>
The tale has been told many times, but it deserves a quick mention 
here as well.  The birth of electroacoustic music meant leaving the 
realm of 'just' notes and stepping into the realm of all sounds.  
This of course might be categorized as a case of historical necessity, 
just like the sound transformation story above, as music's timbral 
expansion has largely characterized music of this century (especially 
music written after 1945).<a href="#FN3"><b><sup>3</sup></b></a>
</p>

<p>
Not only has the the number of sound sources for music grown enormously, 
but the possible sound treatments have grown in equal proportion as our 
technology has evolved.  If one were to study the growth of timbral 
possibilities for the cello for example - e.g. <i>col legno</i> and other 
indications found in Schoenberg scores &#150; and a farther jump beginning 
at the time of the early Darmstadt years &#150; e.g., all the timbral 
research Berio did in preparing his 'Sequenze' &#150; we can see how 
timbral evolution has grown almost exponentially.  Many 'new' sounds 
been created on the front, back, top and bottom of the cello; furthermore 
innovative complex timbral combinations and sound morphologies 
have been created on the cello as well as on all our traditional 
instruments.  It is this point of sound morphology which is now relevant.
</p>

<p>
Along with the known building blocks of electroacoustic music &#150; 
composing with sounds, the search for new structures, new ways of 
listening (see IIB, IIC below) &#150; researching a sound's potential 
development in time (theme and variation?) can become equally as 
important to a composer as the prior choice of sound source materials.  
As mentioned above, this sort of sonorous development can take on 
the form of a sound morphology, similar to the evolution of a cello 
tone.  It can also take on the form of a sound transformation.  
</p>

<p>
What, then, given this introduction is the relevance of sound 
transformations within electroacoustic music?  These sounds can play 
a major role within a composition without falling into the category 
of special effects.  Many commerically available works such as Trevor 
Wishart's <i>Red Bird</i> (1973-77: an analog composition on the record 
YES-7) and <i>Vox-5</i> (1986: a digital composition on the CDs &#150; 
Wergo WER 2024-50 as well as Virgin Classics VC 7 91108-2 / 260 270-231) 
and John Chowning's <i>Phon&eacute;</i> (1980-81: a digital work on the 
CD &#150; Wergo WER 2012-50), just to name a few, illustrate this.  
The relevance of sound transformations can be found at the heart of 
what might be called their aesthetics which can be a very individual 
question.  The aesthetics of sound transformations is the subject of 
Part II.

<a name="AESTHETICS">II &#150; Some words concerning the aesthetics</a> 
of sound transformations
</h2>

<h3>
A) What is meant by the aesthetics of sound transformations?
</h3>

<p>
This article is more concerned with why sound transformations are 
used in electroacoustic music than what they are made from and how 
they are made.  Therefore this discussion is not one of the traditional 
aspect of aesthetics, 'musical beauty', but instead of what might be 
called 'musical dramaturgy' (see Landy: 33 and chapter 7).  In this 
way this section focuses upon musical raisons d'&ecirc;tre for the use 
of sound transformations.  It should be stated here that, as this text 
is not so much 'what' and 'how' oriented, a clear choice has been made 
to discuss this issue from the listener's point of view.  We unfortunately 
have few documents (scores, print-outs) to deal with which could be used 
to discover how these sound transformations work and even less 
information concerning their perception within the musical context of 
a composition.  The following paragraphs are based on personal 
experience, interviews with composers interested in sound 
transformations and more general texts on electroacoustic music 
that were found relevant to this subject.
</p>

<p>
To begin, in a recent article (in Paynter) by the composer/scholar 
Denis Smalley, the term, <b>'transcontextuality'</b> (borrowed from L. 
Hutcheon) in electroacoustic music was introduced.  Smalley writes,

	<blockquote>
'Where the sounds taken from cultural activity or nature are used as 
recorded, or where transformation does not destroy the identity of 
the original context, the listener may become involved in a process of 
transcontextual interpretation. We should include any recorded sound 
event where we are simultaneously aware of two (or more) contexts. ... 
In transcontexts the composer intends that the listener should be aware 
of the dual meanings of a source. The first meaning derives from the 
original, natural or cultural context of the event;  the second 
meaning derives from the new, musical context created by the composer.'
	</blockquote>

Smalley believes in using concrete sounds as the basis for 
transcontextuality as he views their interpretation as being 
based on 'a particular attitude towards the material' as well as 
on a dependence on 'shared norms and meanings'.  Those sounds without 
'real-life context' are by definition ambiguous and therefore would 
not fit into the above description.<a href="#FN4"><b><sup>4</sup></b></a>.  
Do note that an electronic motor-like sound simulating crickets and a 
recording of real crickets may be similar from the listener's point of 
view and are therefore both relevant here (Wishart: 1985, 82).
</p>

<p>
He continues along these lines, 'The concept of transcontextuality is 
a useful way of understanding an indicative process since it is obvious 
that something outside the musical context is indicated.'  But Smalley 
also warns,

	<blockquote>
'The more the composer intervenes in the spectro-morphology 
[see part IIIB for a description] of an identifiable source the more 
vestigial that source will become. ... When transcontextual 
identity becomes less clearly defined the ear relies more on 
alternative indicative interpretations, and the composer remains 
the sole guardian of a dual knowledge.'
	</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
This lengthy borrowing from Denis Smalley has been chosen for many 
important reasons leading to an interest in the music of sound in 
general, and specifically the smaller world of sound transformations, 
are contained in his concept of transcontextuality (although this 
is not the only road leading to Rome).  Obviously as any transformation 
of representational 'A's' and 'B's' will contain a drop of surrealism 
(see part IIB below for an elaboration of the term), change of context 
is implicit.  This is why this concept of Smalley's has been chosen 
here as a starting point.   His desire to offer tangible, that is 
representational sources, is important here.  Surely one can construct 
a sound transformation using only electronic non-representational 
sounds, but its perception will be highly different from the examples 
mentioned in Part I and tends to be less frequently applied than 
representational ones.  One might therefore ask whether 
transformation is possible without changing or dualizing context.

<h2>
<a name="NEWSOUNDS">B) One goal: new sounds and sound structures</a>
</h2>

<p>
One of the greatest attractions of electroacoustic music is the 
ability to search for new sounds (in a musical context) and sound 
structures.<a href="#FN5"><b><sup>5</sup></b></a>.   This is as old 
as the genre, but has not lost its impact after some forty years of 
electroacoustic composition. 
</p>

<p>
As mentioned in Part I, timbral transformation as such is not new.  
Simply stated, the discovery of new sound structures within a 
musical context using sound transformations is inviting to those 
electroacoustic composers sharing this goal.
</p>

<p>
<a href="#SYNOPSIS"><b>Return</b> to list of topics.
</p>


<h3>
<a name="NEWLISTENING">C) Another goal: new ways of listening</a>
</h3>

<p>
This subject also dates from the beginnings of the history of the 
genre.  Think for example of the 'Quatre &Eacute;coutes' 
(Schaeffer: 112-128), Pierre Schaeffer's approach to what he 
calls 'reduced listening'.<a href="#FN6"><b><sup>6</sup></b></a>.
</p>

<p>
The thesis here is a simple one.  <i>By expanding the music of notes 
to the music of sounds</i>, the experience of listening to music has 
been widely broadened.  The Schaeffer notions lay a theoretical 
foundation for discussing the phenomenon of listening to 
electroacoustic music.  What is of interest to us is that through 
the application of sound transformations, creating as it were 
'impossible sound complexes' in the sense that such things do not 
exist in nature, the listener is confronted with transcontextuality.  
</p>

<p>
The combination of creating new timbral material and new musical 
circumstances for the listener must be underlined by a composer's 
musical dramaturgy as such sound complexes can be 'attention-grabbers' 
and therefore should only be used with care.  In a sense one might 
consider the composer's paying special attention to the (passive) 
listening experience as the (active) search for new sounds and 
sound structures as seen through the looking glass.
</p>

<p>
<a href="#SYNOPSIS"><b>Return</b> to list of topics.
</p>


<h3>
<a name="MUSMET">D) Or a combination</a> of these two goals, or even 
something else
</h3>

<p>
Now that we have seen that the aesthetics of this subject can be 
approached from two points of view both involved with the discovery of 
sound, the story is not yet finished, as these two goals are but the 
obvious ones to attract a composer towards applying sound transformations 
within electroacoustic music.  Individuals have their own personal 
reasons which sometimes complement the above.  Before giving the word 
in Part IIE to the composer most associated with sound transformations, 
Trevor Wishart, the word will now be given to him anyway to exemplify one 
personal view. (Wishart: 1991)
</p>

<p>
He speaks of applying metamorphosis to sounds to create 'musical 
metaphors'.  He is interested in narrative (which may be difficult to 
grasp or ambiguous in some works) as opposed to art pour art 
abstraction.  There have been many treatises written on metaphor 
within traditional European instrumental music, but those metaphors 
are rooted in music which is essentially abstract.  It is through 
the concrete nature of most electroacoustic sound transformations 
(by their consisting of two or more representational sounds) that 
the ancient concept of metaphor within a musical framework can be 
modernized.
</p>

<p>
Wishart claims to be highly interested in the combination of mythology 
and music.  Although this particular subject could take us on a large 
detour, one element associated with myths, 'the symbol' is essential 
here.  Wishart speaks of the thought that a sound transformation can 
become 'a truth that reveals itself'. (Wishart: 1991)  Semiologists have 
been searching for signifiers and signifieds in music for a couple of 
decades.  Wishart is of the firm belief that modern symbols can be 
created within the electroacoustic context and are therefore one of 
the main cornerstones of his approach to the choice and application of 
sound transformation in his oeuvre.  Obviously one continually needs 
to search for new sounds to achieve this, and equally obviously the 
listening experience is at the heart of the matter.   As Wishart has 
formulated his dramaturgy to this extent, it offers some food for 
thought for others who might be interested in a similar sonorous 
universe.  These ideas are easily combined with the previously 
mentioned subject of musical surrealism. 
</p>

<p>
This musical surrealism should be finally made more precise now. If 
we think of the traditional surrealist work, be it written, painted, 
sculpted or otherwise, elements of reality were combined in seemingly 
impossible ways (e.g., Salvador Dali's melting watch).  Might it be 
true that sound transformations using identifiable 'A's' and 'B's' are an 
excellent, be it historically late way of attaining a musical form 
of surrealism?  Of course simply mixing sounds that do not belong 
together (e.g., breaking ice and tropical birds) forms another 
version of musical surrealism. In any event it is through the genre 
of musique concrète that musical surrealism has become feasible.
An aesthetic for a surrealist approach to music, including sound 
transformations, is an interesting subject with respect to musical 
dramaturgy and should be looked into in more detail in the future.  
Returning to the concept of transcontextuality, although surrealism 
is just one way of articulating this, the composer should be aware of 
both contexts as articulated by Smalley:  the sound's own context 
as well and the musical&#47;compositional one.

<h3>
<a name="WISHXEN">E) A case</a> in point: Trevor Wishart
</h3>

<p align=center>
<i>'Making a good transformation is like writing a tune. ... There are 
no rules.'</i><a href="#FN7"><b><sup>7</sup></b></a>.
</p>

<p>
Trevor Wishart has done more for sound transformations than any 
other composer or researcher.  He has used them in his compositions 
for some 15 years, beginning with his work <i>Red Bird</i> (see 
Wishart: 1978).  His frequent choice of the voice within sound 
transformations turns out to be an obvious one for him as those 
who know his music realize that he is also one of the most inventive 
composers using extended vocal techniques.  Convenience is not the 
only reason for this combination as we will now see.
</p>

<p>
Wishart claims to have become interested in the concept of transformation, 
not due to the evolutionary step from <i>musique concr&egrave;te</i> 
techniques as one might assume, but through enthusiasm for the 
instrumental transformations he discovered in the early works of 
<b>Iannis Xenakis</b>.  Again, as we found in part IB, the link to the 
tradition of transformation in instrumental music can even be found 
in the work of this highly experimental composer.   Wishart's goal is 
to make transformations with what he calls 'real world sounds'.
</p>

<p>
As mentioned, Wishart has a preference for the narrative and the 
'objective'.  He hopes that his music contains 'more action than 
resonance'; therefore the identification of sources by the listener 
is fundamentally important in his works.  He sometimes speaks of a 
sound transformation's 'story'.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps his use of the term objectivity can best be understood through 
the fact that he chooses his sounds so that the listener can construct 
a relation to that sound's role in human experience.  (Here the concept 
of transcontextuality again comes to the fore.)  This by no means reduces 
the value of Wishart's comment concerning metaphor and metamorphosis, 
for it is through these 'real world sounds' that he achieves his 
contemporary musical mythology, something he expects to work out 
further in his largest-scale work to date, his forthcoming opera 
<i>Orpheus &#150; The Pantomime</i>.
</p>

<p>
<a href="#SYNOPSIS"><b>Return</b> to list of topics.
</p>

<p>
<a name="WISHVOX">One</a> 'real world sound' is used most often, namely 
the <b>human voice</b>.   Wishart writes: 'Certain sounds retain their 
intrinsic recognizability under the most extreme forms of distortion.  The 
most important sound of this type is the human voice, and particularly human 
language, although the particular formant structure of the human voice 
itself has a highly intrinsic recognizability for human beings.  This is 
partly due to the obvious immediate significance of the human voice 
to the human listener, but also the unique complexity of the 
articulation of the source' (Wishart: 1985, 82 &#150; this brings us 
back to part IIC - ways of listening).  Here one notes as we so often 
hear that the voice is the world's most versatile and communicative 
instrument.  It turns out as well that through the voice's flexibility 
it can be used effectively at the beginning or at the end of a sound 
transformation due to its ability to match a corresponding sound.  
As transformations with similar 'A's' and 'B's' tend to be more 
successful than larger-scale interpolations, Wishart's extended 
vocal techniques accordingly have led to successful transformations 
(see the [dis]similarlity section in Part IVB; Wishart says, 'The 
voice can be made to match almost any other sound, apart from bell-like 
stable inharmonic spectra'. [Wishart: 1988, 24]).  So in this composer's 
case, 'Transformations come out of the voice'. Wishart's goal is 
that 'the voice speaks the world'; this is possible given all the 
potential 'B's' to follow the voice's 'A'.
</p>

<p>
Before letting this composer 'talk shop' for awhile, let's briefly 
look into what he said about his composition, <i>Vox-5</i>.  In the 
introduction to his <i>Computer Music Journal</i> article concerning 
the piece, Wishart begins by stating that this fifth of the six part 
<i>Vox</i> series contains a primary aural focus, namely 'a (super)human 
voice that metamorphoses into many recognizable sonic images, such as 
the sounds of crowds, bees, a horse, or bells.' (Wishart: 1988, 21) 
Extended vocal techniques are of course at the heart of these sounds.  
He continues: 'In all the spectral transformations one aesthetic aim 
has been to retain the "source credibility" of the resulting sounds; 
that is, they must always be believably vocal or naturalistic' (although 
he often refers to a transformation's dream-like quality [Wishart: 1988, 
21]).  Discussing the matching of sources (idem: 24), Wishart states 
that in sound transformations, 'The two source sounds should have as 
many similarities as possible ... [W]ith more complex sounds [like 
the voice-L.L.], a high level of acoustic/musical judgment is required 
to match the sources sufficiently before embarking on what can be a 
long interpolation computation.'
</p>

<p>
Wishart finds the subject of perceptual boundaries within sound 
transformations to be of particular importance.  When does it sound 
more 'A-like', when more 'B-like'?  How dangerous or successful is 
the switch at the point of maximum ambiguity? (Wishart: 1988, 24-25)

<p>
<a name="LANDSCAPES">Another subject</a> of interest, as is often the 
case with composers of tape compositions, is Trevor Wishart's involvement 
with <b>'landscapes'</b>, primarily in terms of the transcontextuality issues 
raised above, but also in terms of spatializing the performance of an 
electroacoustic work.  (This latter subject refers to highly interesting 
diffusion questions, but cannot be further treated here.)  In presenting 
his ideas about landscape, Wishart discusses three sorts of 'imaginary 
landscapes' which are important to transcontextuality in general, 
as well as sound transformations specifically (in Emmerson: 48, as 
well as Wishart: 1985, 79-80).  The combination of <b>unreal objects &#47; 
real space</b> is exemplified by the composer with the sonic image of 
substituting birds and animal sounds by arbitrary sound objects 
within a specific landscape.  The converse, <b>real objects &#47; unreal 
space</b> is exemplified by leaving the nature sounds and removing&#47;
changing the context into an unreal (or ambiguous or fictitious, in 
Emmerson: 90) one.  Finally the Wishart surrealistic pair consists of 
<b>real objects &#47; real space</b> where the sounds do not belong to 
the space.  These imaginary landscapes along with a real one where 
sounds and context belong together are a handy way of approaching 
sound transformations within acousmatic conditions.
</p>

<p>
In Part IVB we will return to this concept of landscape or context 
(see the '+1' paragraph).  One of the approaches to be dealt with 
there is Wishart's keeping the sounds constant and instead transforming 
the landscape within a transformation. 
</p>

<p>
Trevor Wishart has a definite preference for the use of what he calls 
dynamic or unstable ('second-order') morphologies for his 'A's' and 
'B's' above clear, periodic ones.  (In his vocal works he has even 
defined special notations for such timbres.)  He emphasizes these 
morphologies while presenting the concept of 'gestural structures 
of sound' in his texts, a notion worthy of special attention at this 
point.
</p>

<p>
Denis Smalley has discussed the importance of the pair, gesture and 
texture at length in his article, 'Spectro-morphology and Structuring 
Processes' (in Emmerson: 81-84 - also part IIIB).  He defines 
<b>gesture</b> as being 'concerned with direction away from a previous 
goal or towards a new goal' and with musical causality.  <b>Texture</b>, 
on the other hand, is concerned with internal behavior patterns ... ' 
(in Emmerson: 82).  So it is primarily gesture that one is involved 
with when discussing sound transformation.  They might best be called 
'gesture carried' structures.<a href="#FN8"><b><sup>8</sup></b></a>.  
Wishart's version of gesture includes four distinguishable gesture 
types  (Wishart: 1985, 67): stable, unstable, leading-to and 
leading-from.  He claims to focus on such gestural types while 
making his transformations.
</p>

<p>
But returning to a more tangible level, this case-in-point composer &#150; 
who has been known to contradict himself at times in a charming 
manner &#150; has often stated that he finds the '&#150;&gt;', the 
interpolation aspect of a given sound transformation more important than 
its 'A' and 'B'.  Essentially his thought is that it is not just the 
transformational concept that is important, but the long, sometimes 
tedious and hopefully rewarding road to a successful transformation 
that is equally of relevance.  In other words a transformation's 
dramaturgy can also be found in its '&#150;&gt;'.
</p>

<p>
So what finally drives Trevor Wishart towards composing with sound 
transformations?  When talking about <i>Vox-5</i> he added a 'Coda':  
'The creation of <i>Vox-5</i> helped me to test out many ideas about 
the control of musical articulation in a continuum, about spectral 
interpolation [i.e. sound transformation - L.L.], and about the 
organization of sound in space. ... The computer opens up areas of 
compositional exploration that were previously inaccessible.  The 
precision with which sound materials can be specified implies ... 
[a]reas of sonic organization previously inaccessible to composers 
through the existing media of notation can be explored, opening a 
new world of dreamed of, but unsung possibilities.' (Wishart: 1988, 
26-27)

<h3>
<a name="PURPOSE">F) A Nota Bene:</a>  music above technique
</h3>

<p>
Before leaving this section a few closing words are apropos.  All the 
above has been written from the MUSICAL point of view.  Most such 
articles tend to put a great deal of weight on the technological 
side of the affair.  Certainly more information must be made public 
concerning the 'how's' of sound transformations,<a href="#FN9"><b>
<sup>9</sup></b></a> but one point should be made at present which 
is at least as important as any other made here.  The choice to use 
sound transformations should be <b>born of a composer's musical intention 
founded upon a solid musical purpose or dramaturgy</b> (that 'why' spoken 
of above).
</p>

<p>
As we all know very well, in today's 'image culture' many a video 
effect can be used to attract a viewer's attention to 
something.<a href="#FN10"><b><sup>10</sup></b></a>  Overuse of visual 
effects, on the other hand, is simply not substantial aesthetically 
and often leads of inferior quality as far as content is concerned.  
In other words, by having a shaky aesthetic basis, or, conversely, 
choosing a technological approach to music where the music itself 
is subserviant to a technological vision, one often arrives at a less 
satisfying musical result.  It is the opinion of the author that music 
must preside above technique at all times (except perhaps when something 
is technologically impossible at present and needs to be invented).  
This must be kept in mind whenever one decides to apply the exciting 
sophisticated potential of sound transformations.  Therefore only a 
few helping hints for users will be offered in Part IV of the current 
text;  everything else here concerns the music or musical goals.

<a name="CENTRALPOINT">III &#150; Before categorizing:</a><br>  why the 
sound sources&#47;timbres aren't the central point here
</h2>

<h3>
A) Background
</h3>

<p>
Do sound transformations have to be categorized in terms of sound 
sources and/or of timbre?  Initially when embarking upon this project, 
the author was uncertain about its feasibilty.  The worry was that 
literally hundreds of transformations would have to be made before 
the results would be worthy of being called a categorization system.  
Then there was the question of whether timbre or specific sound 
sources should be at the focus.  But fortunately this sticky problem 
was circumvented as in fact the idea of the detailed categorization 
system quickly turned out to be an unnecesary one as now will be 
demonstrated.
</p>

<p>
In recent years there have been several attempts towards sound 
categorization (though not one turns out to be as rigorous as 
originally expected) – each seemingly from a different point of view.  
Others interested in this area have been satisfied with their own 
(general) descriptions of sound colour.  Many of these systems are 
credible in their own right, but not necessarily universally applicable.
</p>

<h3>
<a name="SEVENPTS">B) Examples:</a>  Seven approaches to the 
categorization of sounds
</h3>

<ol>
<li><b>Pierre Schaefer</b> &#150; Most obviously one should first think 
of the pioneering work done by Pierre Schaeffer and associates leading 
to his <i>'Solf&egrave;ge de l'objet sonore'</i> (see Schaeffer, Reibel 
and Ferreyra).  Although there never was a system made to classify all 
sound sources or timbres, this was the first important attempt within 
electroacoustic music to provide a reference.  His 'Scheme for the 
classification of sound objects' is the heart of the system (see 
diagram in Schaeffer: 442).  Even for those unable to read French, 
one sees immediately that no specific sounds or sound types (the 
likes of aerophones, chordophones, etc.) are presented here.  Suffice 
it to say that the system works as a universe of itself and that 
composers and musicologists may find it useful for their own individual 
purposes, but Schaeffer has not offered the musical world THE 
all-purpose sound source system.


<li><b>Karlheinz Stockhausen's</b> score for <i>Mikrophonie I</i> for 
6 players (1964) includes an introduction with an entry which is 
essentially its own sound reference list.  This list consists of 
descriptive words to help the performers to approach timbre during 
playing.  Although these terms are by no means exact, they are 
useful for the interpreters.  Examples include: wailing, pitched 
sounds, crackling, grating, crunching and tromboning.  This approach 
differs highly from the above as it has an entirely different, though 
locally useful goal.

<li><b>R. Murray Schafer</b> &#150; One who might have taken the trouble 
to create such a system is R. Murray Schafer who for many years headed 
the World Soundscape Project in which 'acoustic communities' were 
described. Schafer, a prime candidate for the ultimate sound source 
categorization system, only describes the presence of sounds locally 
in this project's major texts. (see the Schafer references)

<li><b>Robert Erickson</b> devoted an entire book to <i>Sound Structures 
in Music</i>, yet the only true step towards categorization can be 
found in his 'transformation triangle' which consists of 'pitch (with 
timbre)', 'a sound' and 'a chord'.  The book is of a more illustrative 
nature.

<li><b>Wayne Slawson's</b> major work in this area, entitled 
<i>Sound Color</i> is based on vowel formant analysis.  His 
employs a terminology which can be of relevance to people who 
want to approach timbre in this manner, but is, as is often the 
case here, useful as A way of discussing sound colour, not THE way.

<li><b>Denis Smalley</b> has written two major texts on 
spectro-morphological thinking in electroacoustic music 
(see Emmerson, Paynter).  Based on Schaeffer's work concerning 
typo-morphology in his <i>Trait&eacute; des objets sonores</i>, Denis 
Smalley writes, 'Spectromorphology is an approach to sound materials a
nd musical structures which concentrates on the spectrum of available 
pitches and their shaping in time.' (in Emmerson: 61)  This has been 
created from the listener's point of view as opposed to the construction 
point of view of the composer and is in the opinion of the author the 
first major attempt to offer all involved in the music of sound a model 
for a potential terminology.  Until now it has been primarily 
musicologists and a few composers who have been influenced by 
Smalley's proposed way of thinking.  It is expected in the future 
that his text will serve as a basis for greater, much needed 
developments in this area.  Still it has not been created specifically 
for the categorization of sounds as such.

<li><b>Trevor Wishart</b> &#150; Let's call on Trevor Wishart once 
again.  In his book, <i>On Sonic Art</i> (Wishart: 1985), he begins 
his treatment of the coherence of sound objects (idem: 37-38) by 
citing Steve McAdams' four groups of sounds for 'audio imaging': 
similar envelopes, parallel frequency modulation, same formant 
characteristics and same apparent spatial location.  We remain 
far from our desired detailed categorzation 
system.<a href="#FN11"><b><sup>11</sup></b></a>.
</ol>

<p>
Again these examples are all potentially useful as far as sound 
transformations are concerned.  However, none will be chosen for 
further consideration; for to make an accurate categorization, one 
would therefore need to choose at least one of these systems, including 
one with a largely detailed approach to sound sources and/or timbre, and 
virtually try out every sort of transformation on every sort of sound 
to create a sound transformation categorization system.  However by 
re-reading the previous sentence we are led to the crux of the reason 
which made this sort of work finally unnecessary.  'Every sort of 
transformation on every sort of sound' implies that a sound transformation 
categorzation system has already been made and then tested with every 
type of timbre and/or sound source.  We will only be interested in 
the former subject in Part IV.
</p>

<p>
Having said that, we must let technology preside above musical 
application for a few lines for once in this text.  As was proven 
in the experiments in creating sound transformation examples during 
the preparation of this article, certain types of transformations 
work differently/better using various types of techniques and are 
therefore worthy of specific attention.  These will be specified in 
Part IVC below.

transformations:<br>

<h3>
A) Introduction:  The three 'how's'
</h3>

<p>
This final section is a non-high tech attempt to delineate the world of 
sound transformations.  This is not intended to be a user's guide with 
how-to examples, but simply a basic introduction to what sorts of 
methods and types of transformations are possible offering the first 
model of its kind &#150; be it a simple one &#150; which hopefully will 
invite others to participate in its future 
expansion.<a href="#FN12"><b><sup>12</sup></b></a>. 
</p>

<p>
<a name="3HOWS"><b>The three 'how's'</a> to make a sound transformation 
are:</b>
<ol>
<li><b>Electroacoustically</b> (through analog and/or digital treatment 
of recordings or previously generated sounds).  This is most likely the 
most tedious way to go about this sort of work. 

<li><b>Through synthesis</b> (digital sound generation using e.g. 
<i>Csound</i> or <i>Cmusic</i> leading to transformation), which 
sometimes may become a cumbersome process as well.

<li><b>Through resynthesis</b> (e.g., through the use of the the 
<i>Phase Vocoder</i> which first analyses input sound data and then 
allows sound manipulation to take place including interpolation, 
shifting of spectra, stretching, etc. all of which can be used 
towards the creation of sound transformations).  This is the method 
used most often currently.  See Wishart (1988) for a general 
introduction to the relevant techniques and routines. 
</ol>

<p>
<a href="#SYNOPSIS"><b>Return</b> to list of topics.
</p>

<h3>
<a name="4CATEGORIES">B) Four</a> (plus one) categories of sound 
transformations
</h3>

<p>
During the course of the project four categories, each in the form 
of a parameter, were found which seem to span the space of sound 
transformation types.  These parameters are absolutely not mutually 
exclusive.
<ol>
<li><b>Comparability: A and B are very comparable to the ear ... 
incomparable</b> (do note that our technology is currently unable 
to transform sounds 'naturally' that are quite dissimilar, at 
least as far as our perception is concerned).
</p>

<p>
In fact the most similar ones most resemble sound morphological 
movement.  Between the time this paper is written and the time it 
is printed the amount of potential dissimilarity in perceptually successful 
transformations will probably increase;  therefore, it is useless 
to attempt to define where the borderline is or will be at any given 
point.  This parameter therefore concerns the extent of transformation.  
(It should be stated that questions the likes of:  are A and B based on 
stable or unstable morphologies, are they more pitch or noise based, 
may be added here but are not central to this categorization system.)
</p>

<p>Again Denis Smalley's terminology is of use to us.  In his recent 
article (in Paynter) he discusses the concepts of 'graduated' and 
'interpolatory shifts'.  Although Smalley is not directly addressing a 
categorization of sound transformations &#150; he is addressing what he 
calls 'shifts in sounding models' &#150; these terms are useful as 
'graduated' refers to sounds 'based on shared morphological attributes', 
and interpolatory 'ignores common attributes and emphasizes dramatic 
differences'.
</p>

<li><b>Are the sounds both sequential (discrete) ... continuous?</b>
<p>
This leads to various approaches to transformation.  Short sounds 
transform better through sequential repetition and development.  
Continuous sounds transform better within their own continuity.  
Anything in between is to be treated based on specific features.
</p>

<li><b>Is the transformation to be short (from grain level) ... long</b> 
(eventually up to the structural level of a work)?
<p>
Trevor Wishart has said that a sound transformation using recognizable 
end points must last at least four seconds to be clearly perceived as 
being a sound transformation as such.  Of course those composers who 
are not in need of this recognition or are working with abstract 
materials or structural approaches could essentially choose for 
transformation to take place at a granular or even on a large-scale 
structural level.  Individual goals are perhaps more relevant here than 
elsewhere.<a href="#FN13"><b><sup>13</sup></b></a>. 
</p>

<li><b>A and B are representational</b> (clearly identifiable, mimesis 
intended) <b>... ambiguous ... abstract</b> (unclear, nonrepresentational)
<p>
This final category does not need any further elaboration.
</p>
</ol>

<h3>
Some extras:
</h3>

<p>
Here it should be reiterated that we have talked about the sorts of 
transformations, not how we go about them.  Let's return to Wishart's 
mocking remark that the '&#150;&gt;' between the A and B, i.e., the 
interpolation process itself is at least as important as its main 
characters.  A sound transformation may be linear, it may follow a 
concave or convex curve of interpolation.  Other even more complicated 
routes may be taken.  There may be intermediate stages the 
transformation passes through.  There may even be a 'C' and 'D'...
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, a composer may have personal preferences as to how such 
transformations should/must be made.  Therefore a given A &#150;&gt; B 
may sound very different than another transformation with the same end 
points.  One might choose to use characteristic analysis to feature 
certain parts of A's and/or B's spectrum during the interpolation or 
other transformation process. 
	<blockquote>
<b>(+1)</b> An issue mentioned a number of times above is now added to 
our four categories here as an 'extra'.  This concerns keeping the 
sound objects, but changing the context, a sort of sound transformation 
which is the fifth of the four categories and is therefore named 
separately (as it concerns a spatial or contextual transformation, not 
directly a sound transformation).  Smalley refers to this area as the 
outer limit of what he calls 'spatio-morphology' (morphology being in 
a sense singular, transformation plural, in Emmerson: 91)  An excellent 
example of dealing with this element is Bernard Parmegiani's <i>Dedans 
dehors</i> (1976 on record - INA-GRM 9102Pa).  (What's in a name?).

<h3>
<a name="FISCHMAN">C) Some final tips</a>
</h3>

<p>
This final paragraph is offered to those working with sound 
transformations or are about to try creating some.  Rajmil Fischman 
has provided the following seven suggestions which, depending on the 
circumstances and the context of a composition, may help in producing 
convincing results.
</p>

<ol>
<li><b>Differentiability:</b> &nbsp;The 'A' and 'B' of a sound 
transformation must be perceived as such. For example, a transformation 
from a soft trumpet timbre into a flute may not be perceived because 
the steady state of both of these sounds is similar.  The main 
perceptual difference resides in their attacks.

<li><b>Similarity:</b> &nbsp;As previously mentioned, some common 
characteristics between the 'A' and 'B' help in achieving continuity 
in transformations.  For example, sounds that have the same pitch 
are recommended.  (Sounds with different pitches can be problematic 
to convert into one another.)  Transformation between a highly pitched 
and a non-pitched sound may require some pre-processing to achieve 
similarity:  gradually making the pitched sound more noisy by means of 
thickening, frequency modulation, etc. and&#47;or gradually making 
the non-pitched sound less noisy during the transformation by means 
of time variable filters, etc.

<li><b>Duration:</b> &nbsp;The duration of a transformation is dependent 
on the type of sounds.  This is probably the most difficult characteristic 
to generalize.  Perhaps the closest one can get to this is saying that 
sounds with slowly changing morphologies will probably require longer 
transformations than quickly changing ('gestural') ones.  Furthermore, 
transformation between slowly changing long sounds and short ones may 
not work.

<li><b>Linearity:</b> Whether to choose a linear or exponential 
transformation depends again on how fast and how violently it is to 
be perceived.  If we take two transformations of the same duration, 
one linear and the other exponential (= exp(a) where a &gt; 1), they may 
be perceived as having different durations because of the slowness of 
the change of the latter at the beginning of the transformation and 
its speedy variation toward the end.

<li><b>Spatial movement:</b> &nbsp;One of the criteria used by our 
perception when separating sound sources is their position and movement 
in space.  Therefore, if two sounds have the same spatial movement, we 
are cancelling one of the characteristics that make them appear as 
coming from different sources.  However, convincing spatial movement 
of a transformation (including Doppler shifts) – e.g. the 'A' at one 
point, the interpolation moving along a continuous stream towards 
the 'B' at the final destination – can assist the listener's perception 
of a sound transformation.

<li><b>Diversions:</b> &nbsp;Even if the first five points have been 
taken into account, there may be a problem that our perception does 
not accept the transformation, the '&#150;&gt;' as containing either 
the 'A' or the 'B'.  Instead one may hear an unrelated unrecognizable 
sound, a sort of 'grey area'.  In this case, the ear needs to be 'fooled' 
by attracting the attention of the listener to something else, including 
a third sound, happening at the same time.

<p>One such technique is called 'blurring' (also known as 'wedging'&#47;
'reverse wedging', 'flocking' &#150; see Wishart [1978]).  Here during 
the transformation several layers of the same or slightly modified sound 
are used to aid in the natural flow from A &#150;&gt; B.  This how-to 
recipe is taken from the sound transformation kitchen as it is used 
surprisingly often.  (This technique was used originally by Wishart 
in <i>Red Bird</i> to hide analog technical limitations.)  The classical 
example is probably Wishart's vocal buzz &150;&gt; bee swarm 
transformation in <i>Vox-5</i>.  In order to capture the attention of 
the listener, the spectrum of the vocal buzz is made to change 
independently of the transformation while the latter is taking place.
</p>

<li><b>Context:</b> &nbsp;The context of the actual piece may help 
overcome some other difficulties.  When there is a common element, 
e.g., Wishart's voice, in several of a work's transformations, this 
can stimulate the perception of a 'voice to ...' (or whatever) quality 
through a sort of pattern recognition.  Perhaps a transformation 
might not sound convincing when heard outside of the context of a 
piece, but can work in context for this very reason.

<a name="FN1"><li></a>It is useful to mention that Trevor Wishart subdivides morphologies of sound into a dimension ranging from what he calls intrinsic morphologies 
(things that sound the way they are, e.g., the sound of striking or breaking glass) to imposed ones (e.g., the manipulation of the vocal chords when 
speaking or singing).  Many blown instruments which are influenced in terms of their timbres whilst including heavy doses of their own spectrum 
exemplify the halfway point between the two extremes.  (Wishart, 1985, 97).  We will return to this topic below.
</p>

<p>
<a name="FN2"><li></a>By the way:  timbral metamorphosis' equally interesting well-known cousins, tonal and harmonic metamorphosis are common as well.  They call for 
'natural' transitions between tonalities or harmonic fields but are not directly relevant to timbre.
</p>

<p>
<a name="FN3"><li></a>Of course, this new genre has also been proven interesting in terms of our spatial awareness, especially where performance focuses upon this subject as 
well.  The treatment of space will be briefly mentioned below (Part IIIB - Smalley, Part IVB - 'Some extras').
</p>

<p>
<a name="FN4"><li></a>One of Smalley's hypotheses dating from an earlier text (in Emmerson: 61) is that 'listeners can only apprehend music if they discover a perceptual 
affinity with its materials and structure.'  Although the subject of structure will prove to be less important to the current discussion, suffice it to say that 
the author feels that this statement is not  to be underestimated.  How the listener gets used to and learns to appreciate new materials and structures is 
one of the greatest challenges facing today's composer.
</p>

<p>
<a name="FN5"><li></a>One could add the words 'musical structures', but this is generally true of all contemporary music and is less relevant to many electroacoustic works 
than to their instrumental/vocal counterparts (as is generally accepted).  There are virtually no common denominators in the electroacoustic genre.  
Compositional structure is rarely linked to the application of sound transformations anyway (according to most composers using them).  Therefore we 
can limit ourselves to the more micro-level details of a work.
</p>

<p>
<a name="FN6"><li></a>An aside to those interested in this subject:  Denis Smalley has refined the Schaeffer approach in his recent article, 'The Listening Imagination' (in 
Paynter).  He speaks of three 'relationships' of listening:  the indicative, reflexive and interactive.  (Anecdotically a fourth relationship, technical 
listening, i.e. listening to how sounds have been made, may be added to this list, a strange way of listening to music at best).  These relationships form 
the basis of his discussion leading to what he calls nine 'indicative fields' that prove most useful as far as creating a working terminology for the 
perception of electroacoustic music is concerned (see also Part III below).  The author refers the reader to Smalley's text for further detail.
</p>

<p>
<a name="FN7"><li></a>Where no further information is provided, the Wishart citations are from a conversation at his home in York, 10 July, 1991.
</p>

<p>
<a name="FN8"><li></a>Smalley describes various 'surrogacies' in his gesture discussion.  A first order surrogacy concerns 'the traditional business of instrumental music.'  A 
second order surrogacy is 'where gesture is surmised from the energetic profile but an actual instrumental cause cannot be known or does not exist.'  A 
remote surrogacy is defined as occurring when 'links with surmised causality are progressively loosened so that physical cause cannot be deduced, and 
we thus enter the realms of psychological interpretation alone.'
</p>

<p>
<a name="FN9"><li></a>As mentioned in the introduction, in a later phase of the current research project, a user-friendly environment for the creation of sound transformations 
using the Phase Vocoder, most likely using DSP (digital signal processing) for added speed, is to be made in collaboration with a number of British 
colleagues.  Along with this, a user's manual for Phase Vocoder sound transformations will be written which will complement the current text.  The 
software is being written for the Composers' Desktop Project (CDP) Computer Music System and all documentation will be available from them.  For 
further information please contact CDP.  Furthermore, a 1993 issue of the periodical Interface will 
be published on this theme.  Many of the main figures in this text will be among the contributors.
</p>

<p>
<a name="FN10"><li></a>Too many of us involved in music concentrate too heavily on sonic art and tend to forget or ignore parallel developments in the visual arts.  In the 
visual arts transformations are being developed in the time-based arts (such as video) as well as in image processing.  We all are acquainted with the 
former which has been highly developed in recent years through sophisticated computer animation.  For those interested in the scientific basis of 
computer graphic 'image mosaics' (e.g., an apple merging into an orange within one single image), see the article by Burt and Adelson.
</p>

<p>
<a name="FN11"><li></a>Later (p. 76) Wishart reminds his readers that dealing with sound objects may be divided into 1) the nature of perceived acoustic objects, 2) the 
dispersion of the sound objects within the space, and 3) the recognition of individual sound-objects.  Here our one subject has been divided into three.  
This gets worked out further in terms of the sounds' morphologies (internal morphologies consisting of continuous, iterative or unstable bases;  when a 
morphology is unstable, a sound's morphology may move from one to another [Wishart: 1985, 97]).
</p>

<p>
<a name="FN12"><li></a>It should be mentioned that the subject of MIDI has been avoided.  To make a sound transformation, MIDI technology lacks sufficient sophistication 
and can only be used to play back sound transformations through a sampler.
</p>

<p>
<a name="FN13"><li></a>It has often been mentioned that some works known to contain transformations include many that are too quick or difficult to perceive, or contain 
hardly or unrecognisable 'A's' and/or 'B's'.  If the composer does not mind this, it is fine, but it has occurred that composers have given talks about 
transformations that are in fact inaudible.  If recognizability is important, then Wishart's remark should be taken into account.
