<h2  id="MUSINTRO">Musical Aspects of Working with Sound</h2>

<p>
Sound Transformation software such as the CDP System is designed 
to transform sounds in weird and wonderful ways, and with extreme 
subtlety in the fine-tuning.  This touches on today's forays into 
'sonic art' and 'sound design': composing with the qualities of 
sound itself as well as with notes and rhythms.  The realm of 
orchestral scoring has always dealt with tonal qualities 
in its own way, but music has moved much deeper into this realm 
since the advent of the 'classic' sound studio based on the use 
of tape recorders, synthesisers and samplers, FFT analysis and 
manipulation of digital data by computer, using software algorithms.
</p>

<p>
Working with sound in this way in an effective manner requires a 
fundamental extension of musical aesthetic.  We are now exploring 
the inner regions of sound in a way never before possible.  This 
is exciting enough as a scientific and technical endeavour.  It 
becomes even more exciting when the tremendous richness of sounds 
begins to be employed in the service of musical expression.  To do 
this, we have to use the technical, but move beyond it, making 
connections with the basics of shaping time:  musical art.  The 
terms described in this musical glossary are familiar enough.  Here, 
however, a special effort is being made to connect these familiar terms 
with relevant aspects of the electronic manipulation of sound, to show 
how the latter can be used in the service of musical art. 
</p>

<p>
<br />
</p>

<!-- ========================================================================= -->
<h3 id="ACCELERANDO"><b>ACCELERANDO</b> &#150; an increase in 
tempo
</h3>

<p>
Accelerando means getting faster.  Music moves along at a given 
tempo, meaning the rate at which the main beats occur.  During 
an accelerando, this tempo increases.  Just as the heartbeat accelerates 
when running or in a fear-inducing situation, accelerando implies 
excitement, the nature of which is determined by the surrounding 
context.  The opposite is a decelerando.
</p>

<p>
<br />
</p>

<h3 id="ARTICULATION"><b>ARTICULATION</b> &#150; the changing 
amplitude and timbral character of a sound, usually the result of 
how a performer plays a musical instrument
</h3>

<p>
The word 'articulated' is used to describe flexibility in movement, 
such as an 'articulated truck' in which the cab and storage section 
are independent units connected by a ball joint.  The term is used 
in music to describe flexibility in a performer's movements, such that 
the manner of performance is always changing: extra energy at the beginning 
of a sound (attack transient), increasing and decreasing pressure on the 
bow or mouthpiece (crescendo &#47; decrescendo), staccato and saltando 
bouncing, dancing effects, use of mutes to alter the tone, whisperingly 
quiet, etc.  This performance flexibility brings a piece of music to life, 
distinguishes one performer from another, projects the inner intention 
of the music, and is altogether one of the most important aspects of 
music-making.  When working with electronically generated sound, every 
effort needs to be made to achieve a similar flexibility:  the music 
should not just play back through the speakers, <i>the listener should 
feel that it is being performed</i>.
</p>

<p>
<br />
</p>

<h3 id="CRESCENDO"><b>CRESCENDO</b> &#150; gradually becoming louder
</h3>

<p>
During a crescendo, the music gradually becomes louder.  The opposite is 
a decrescendo.  As music is a time-based art, every change over time has 
a poetic meaning.  A crescendo indicates a gradual increase in excitement 
or tension, a decrescendo, a relaxation of effort or an easing of tension.  
These changes of volume are one of the most basic ways to give the music 
a living, organic feel.  Similarly, moving along at the same volume can 
be part of communicating a steady state, contented, or resigned frame of 
mind.
</p>

<p>
Crescendo and decrescendo can also be realised in an 'orchestral' way.  
Sometimes this is accompanied by a change of volume, but not necessarily.  
An 'orchestral crescendo' is achieved by adding in more instruments, so 
that the overall sound and tone becomes more complex, fuller, richer.  
</p>

<p>
An 'orchestral crescendo' can also be achieved in the electronic domain.  
The sound itself can be enriched by changes which make it timbrally denser 
and more complex: i.e., by compressing or adding in more frequency 
components.  We can also layer in more instruments or effects by chaining 
processes and mixing operations.
</p>

<p>
<br />
</p>

<h3 id="FORM"><b>FORM</b> &#150; the temporal design resulting 
from the basic idea for a piece
</h3>

<p>
A musical form is really the idea behind a piece worked out in both 
the inner pattern detail and the overall temporal design such that 
everything hangs together and serves a common purpose &#150; whether 
this purpose is harmonious unity or chaotic diversity.  The verse and 
chorus sections of a song, for example, alternate narrative detail and 
general statements which capture the essence of attitude or mood.  The 
musical setting of these words usually supports their meaning with 
gestural shapes, harmony, rhythm, articulations and tonal qualities, 
unless deliberate irony is sought.
</p>

<p>
Suppose the idea for a song or piece of music were to be urban 
complexity.  This might suggest interleaving widely divergent sonic 
material, fast cutting from one scene to another, tonal complexes, 
angular rhythms, and incisive articulations.  Putting all these 
features in place constitutes the practical, step-by-step process of 
form-building.
</p>

<p>
Another idea for a song or piece of music might be isolation and 
loneliness, perhaps poignantly summed up in the song's chorus section.  
The task of realising this idea in the music might focus on this 
chorus section, approaching it and leaving it through moments of 
quietly sustained material.  Gestures and contour shapes might maintain 
low, slowly changing profiles.
</p>

<p>
The basic idea as expressed in words, or just a simple abstract idea 
such as 'rising' becomes the guide to building a form, shape by shape, 
step by step, until the whole emerges from the detail.  The overall 
idea guides the shaping of the detail, but it is also a fact that what 
happens when working on the detail can affect and reshape the original 
idea.  The various musical terms described here show how the realm of 
sound, electronically manipulated, can be used to create this detail.  
But the purpose, the basic idea, needs to remain in focus as the guiding 
light in order to achieve organic unity and emotional power.
</p>

<p>
The term 'form' as used here relates to the overall organising idea 
of a composition, its 'commanding form' as Susanne Langer says, or 
its 'ur-form' to use Schoenberg's term.  A Endrich is currently seeking 
to articulate a lower level of form that lies between the ur-form 
and specific techniques of composition.  He calls this level 
'micro-forms' and considers them to be generic time-based processes 
that generate the musical argument of a composition.
</p>

<p>
<br />
</p>

<h3 id="GESTURE"><b>GESTURE</b> &#150; dramatic meaning of a contour 
and articulation pattern over time
</h3>

<p>
We are most familiar with the concept of gesture from the realm of 
theatre and dance.  We perceive it as a distinctive and commanding shape 
which conveys psychological intent (or just pure form).  It is also a key 
ingredient in music, giving it intent, purpose, 'feel'.  Perhaps we could 
describe gesture as <b>contour with meaning</b>.  Similarly, the underlying 
contour shapes in a painting play an important role in its interpretation.
</p>

<p>
Changing parameter values inevitably create a <b>contour</b> as they move 
higher and lower.  Whether this contour is gradual with soft edges, abrupt, 
slowly changing or jagged already has feeling &#47; psychological 
implications.  The amount of displacement and rate of change are major 
factors in gesture because they create varying levels of intensity:  the 
shape itself implies different levels of energy needed to create it.  The 
sonic artist continues to develop the meaning of this contour in many other 
ways, matching attack transients, tonal color and other articulations to 
give it the right energy profile.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes an artform is full of 'dramatic' gestures.  At other times, 
the gestures are soft, supple, relaxed or elegant.  Getting the gestures 
to match the overall form, character and intent of the artistic creation 
is a key task.  The organic unity of a piece is to some degree tied into 
the repetition of gestural shapes, often in different parameter fields 
and time levels.  These are, then, important considerations to bear in 
mind when designing envelope contours and automating parameters.
</p>

<p>
<br />
</p>

<h3 id="GLISSANDO"><b>GLISSANDO</b> &#150; gradual change of 
pitch perceived as a sliding movement
</h3>

<p>
Except for the odd humorous trombone slide or expressive slide across 
the strings of a violin or the keys of a piano, glissando has been a 
rarity in the music of the past.  In our own time, this has changed 
enormously.  A glissando is a pitch slide, and pitch slide (or pitch 
'bend') has been used extensively in all forms of jazz and popular music, 
both in voice and instruments.  Particularly with the voice, pitch slides 
with timbral changes (e.g., rough to smooth) are an incredibly important 
and skillful aspect of performance.  Similarly, composers such as Iannis 
Xenakis have astonished audiences by making whole pieces dominated by 
glissandi.
</p>

<p>
Even so, Nature has been way ahead of us.  What do we hear when a 
flock of 100+ starlings gather but a whole texture of glissandi?  
What about the roar of volcanoes and the whooshes of avalanches, 
the fluid movements of landslides and mountain streams and waterfalls?  
Now that we are working directly with sonic material, these shapes 
become relevant, become possible!  Paradoxically, while working 
with the most advanced computerised systems, we find ourselves coming 
closer to Nature.
</p>

<p>
The ability to create glissandi is, therefore, an important facility 
in all of the CDP pitch&#47;frequency transposition programs.  Using 
programs such as MODIFY SPEED, REPITCH TRANSPOSE or FOCUS ACCUMULATE, 
finely crafted pitch bends, gigantic slides or flowing, throbbing complexes 
can be created.  Emotional nuances, sensations of flying or falling, 
flowing, fluid turbulence found in Nature &#150; all have a sliding, 
flowing form and can be evoked by musical glissandi.  Glissandi are 
achieved by creating time-varying <a href="filestxt.htm#BREAKPOINTFILES">
<b>breakpoint files</b></a>.
</p>

<p>
<br />
</p>

<h3 id="GRANULATE"><b>GRANULATE</b> &#150; to separate into 
very tiny segments of sound
</h3>

<p>
We are familiar with grains of sand, salt and sugar, but not necessarily 
<a href="glosstec.htm#GRAIN"><b>grains of sound</b></a>.  Yet this is 
entirely possible with the computer, which can divide up and play with 
the stream of numbers representing the sound in any way one likes.  A 
granulated sound usually comes out as a series of tiny pulsations, a 
sonic surface like sandpaper, with the degree of coarse or fine 
depending on the size of the grains and overlap factors.
</p>

<p>
By extension, any sound with a noticeably rough surface of 
(semi-)regular attacks can be said to be 'granulated' or grainy.  
Trevor uses the word 'grain' as it may help the user to find the 
GRAIN programs, specifically meant for dealing with such sounds.  
Also, natural grainy sounds have only semi-regular attacks &#150; 
regular attacks immediately make them sound synthetic.
</p>

<p>
<br />
</p>

<h3 id="HARMONY"><b>HARMONY</b> &#150; vertical relationship 
that forms the basis for sonority
</h3>

<p>
Harmony takes on a new, much broader meaning when creating music with 
sounds.  One of the reasons for this is that many sounds from the 
natural world are very complex.  Some birds, such as the wood thrush, 
can sing three pitches at once, warbling on two of them and sustaining the 
third.  The sound of a train is a veritable compendium of sounds.
</p>

<p>
We are mostly used to 'pitches' in music: clear tones in which one 
main pitch (called the 'fundamental') is loud and clear, while the 
other partials in the sound are harmonious with it:  locked into it 
by being frequency multiples: 'harmonics').  Large bells have such a 
big surface area that they can create more than one pitch at the 
same time, easily perceived as separate.  I recall hearing a beautiful 
bell ringing out across a valley in Switzerland: two pitches a fifth 
apart were audible and slowly phased against each other.
</p>

<p>
As we move into the realms of nature and machines, sounds become 
altogether more complex, so if we are going to use these sounds at 
all in music, much less use them effectively, we need to broaden 
our understanding of harmony.

	<ul>
	<li>Harmony can mean more than a chord made up of pitches.  
	It can be any sonority and indeed any prolongation which 
	becomes an aural reference to which other pitch levels 
	relate.</li>
	<li>An extended concept of harmony needs to include <b>noise</b> 
	(random frequency complexes), and recognise that there are many 
	different flavours of noise.  <a href="glosstec.htm#FILTER">
	<b>Filters</b></a> are often used to modify noise so that it acquires 
	the right tonal qualities for the situation: soft and low, high 
	and thin, broad and fuzzy.</li>
	<li>Different types of noise can be overlapped and layered, 
	producing changing densities and transitions.</li>
	<li>The harmonics (partials which are integer multiples) of a 
	sound can be thrown askew by adding fixed frequency intervals 
	to them, thus altering the timbral qualities of the sound.  This 
	process is called linear shift and is handled by the function 
	STRANGE SHIFT</li>
	<li>Sound complexes are handled in terms of their density and 
	tonal qualities (e.g., high, bright, thin, warm, deep and fuzzy, 
	rumbling etc.), rather than simply as pitches belonging to 
	scales and chords.  The concept of a scale becomes broadened 
	to include gradients of tonal qualities, and chords become sonic 
	layer cakes.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>
<br />
</p>

<h3 id="LOOP"><b>LOOP EFFECTS</b> &#150; repeating patterns
</h3>

<p>
In general, this refers to repeating patterns.  Many software packages 
automatically loop a sound (repeat with a smooth join) so that changes 
are applied continuously.  CDP's EXTEND LOOP program offers a different 
set of possibilities by controlling the movement of segments of 
specified length: gaps or overlap.
</p>

<p>
In software such as Cakewalk's <b>Project5</b>, the input musical 
sound from the software synthesiser repeatedly loops back to the 
beginning to give a continuous sound output.  Using the LFOs in 
its plugin <i>Spectral Transformer</i> (a CDP creation), various 
parameters can be set to loop round a waveform pattern, whether 
quickly or slowly &#150; more noticeably when the LFO is set to 
a slow speed.  This repeating pattern of parameter change is then 
phased across the repeating input sound.  The result can be a wild, 
churning sound, or one with slow, controlled timbral evolution.  
There is, then, also looping that affects small internal segments 
of the sound.
</p>

<p>
In general, regular looping is an extremely mechanical process, not 
found in naturally occurring sound sources.  It appears to be a 
very important psycho-acoustic feature of sound that completely 
regular repetition always sounds contrived, whereas natural sounds 
that appear to be repetitive (e.g., the rolled 'rrr', the sound 
of crickets, etc.) are full of subtle variations of timing, pitch 
and spectrum.
</p>

<p>
To produce a more natural effect, therefore, CDP (T Wishart) has 
developed EXTEND ITERATE, which allows you to vary the timing, pitch 
and loudness of the repeated elements.  ITERATE tries to produce a 
'naturalistic' rather than a mechanical 'looping' of sounds.  Compare 
the output of EXTEND LOOP with the output of EXTEND ITERATE using 
very small (less than 0.1 semitone) pitch variation, small 
randomisations of the timing and small amplitude shifts.  It is 
difficult to imagine that the two output sounds are from the same 
source.
</p>

<p>
<br />
</p>

<h3 id="MONTAGE"><b>MONTAGE</b> &#150; mixing disparate material 
to form complex sequences
</h3>

<p>
This technique has been familiar in music since the evolution of the 
'development section' of sonatas.  However, more specifically, it 
was developed by Russian film-makers in the early part of the 20th 
century, such as Eisenstein and Verkapich.  Both sound and image 
were patterned in complex ways to achieve specific effects.  The 
<i>Britannia Micropaedia</i> article on the subject (Vol. 8) 
describes how Alfred Hitchcock repeats the word 'knife' in the 
thoughts of a frightened girl who believes she has committed 
murder.
</p>

<p>
The montage form of assembly has been an important part of the 
evolution of music in the 20th century and particularly of <i>musique 
concr&egrave;te</i> since its earliest days.  The emphasis is on 
the amalgamation of disparate material, while with other types of 
texture the emphasis is on replicating the same or similar material.  
Pieces such as Stockhausen's <i>Momente</i> and <i>Hymnen</i> 
provide many examples of audio montage.
</p>

<p>
<br />
</p>

<h3 id="MORPH"><b>MORPH</b> &#150; change one sound gradually 
into another
</h3>


<p>
The various approaches to morphing audio are described in the 
<a href="cmorph.htm#MORPH"><b>Reference Manual</b></a> and in the 
<a href="tut12stp.htm#INTRO9"><b>12 Step Tutorial</b></a>.
</p>

<p>
The key words with morphing are 'change' and 'gradually'.  We are 
familiar with the way visual images are distorted as one shape is 
bent out of shape in the process of changing it to another image.  
These striking images are staple diet in cartoons and now have a new 
lease of life through CGI (Computer Graphic Imaging).  The movement 
is relatively slow, whether at 24, 25 or 30 frames per second, which 
is OK for the eye.
</p>

<p>
The process is not at all easy in audio, because the ear is so finely 
attuned to the smallest changes &#150; the ear can detect quality 
differences in sample rates at 22500, 44100 or 96000 samples per second!  
Our generic recommendations therefore are:
	<ul>
	<li>Give yourself a chance by using sounds which are reasonably 
	similar.  It is very difficult to get two very different sounds to 
	sound as if they are changing the one into the other.</li>
	<li>Pre-process the sounds to even out any salient differences, such 
	as in pitch or amplitude level.</li>
	<li>Give an audio morph plenty of time.  If it happens too quickly, 
	the ear will not hear any detail in the process of change.</li>
	<li>Create an intermediate stage in which the first sound assumes 
	<i>some</i> of the characteristics of the second sound.  Morph from 
	the first sound to this intermediate stage, and then from this 
	intermediate stage to the second sound.  The above references make 
	several suggestions on how this might be done.</li>
	<li>Perhaps stagger the entry of the intermediate or second sound 
	in order to give the ear more time to 'take in' the nature of the 
	morphing-from sound.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>
<br />
</p>


<h3 id="RANDOM"><b>RANDOMISE</b> &#150; unpredictability 
based on random number generation
</h3>

<p>
The ability of computers to produce random number series 
provides the basis for many procedures useful to composers.  
They are often generated within (time-varying) upper and 
lower limits, to give added compositional control.
</p>

<p>
On the one hand, it can help to give a natural feel to 
<a href="#RHYTHM"><b>rhythms</b></a>, especially with 
multi-event <a href="#TEXTURE"><b>textures</b></a>.  
But many other parameters are suitable to randomisation, 
such as segment positions and lengths, pitch, volume, 
spatial placement etc.  All of these are implemented 
in the TEXTURE Set, BRASSAGE, and <i>GrainMill</i>.  
The TEXTURE Set also uses randomisation to select 
among several defined motifs or ornaments.
</p>

<p>
Randomisation also gives flexibility in the EXTEND 
programs DRUNK, SCRAMBLE and ZIGZAG.  Whenever there 
are <i>min &#150; max</i> lower and upper limits, 
selections are made between these (time-varying) 
limits by a randomisation procedure.  As usual, 
compositional control increases when there are 
constraints to work within.
</p>

<p>
Although it can be over-used, randomisation is an 
important tool for the sonic composer.  The temporal 
placement of sounds (as opposed to 
<a href="glosstec.htm#PITCH"><b>pitches</b></a>) can 
seem artificial if they are too regular in a context 
that doesn't justify such regularity.  Randomisation 
enables the composer to loosen things up, as well 
as to introduce unpredicatability without having to 
hand-code every variant.
</p>

<p>
<br />
</p>

<h3 id="RHYTHM"><b>RHYTHM</b> &#150; patterns of event-timing, 
sometimes randomised
</h3>

<p>
Working with sound also requires, at times, a more flexible 
approach to rhythm.  For much of the time, altering the tonal 
qualities is designed to give just the right feel to the beat, 
whether with the type of attack transient, the brightness or 
warmth of the sound, or the pitch bend which shapes its pitch.  
A slight randomisation of where the beats fall has been shown 
to 'humanise' the rhythm, to sound less mechanical and more as 
if produced by live performers.
</p>

<p>
At other times, the sounds and textures are more complex, and 
we come closer to the world of Nature, in which regular rhythms 
are the exception rather than the rule.  If we recall the 
texture of birdsong emitted by a seagulls or listen to the wind 
moving through the leaves of an aspen, we realise that there is a 
significant random dimension in the sounds of Nature.  When using 
natural sounds, or abstract sound complexes for which there are no 
known equivalents, it is often useful to make use of some degree of 
randomisation in the rhythmic feel.
</p>

<p>
Effective use of these possibilities requires daring and imagination, 
but also a regard for the overall idea (form) of the music.
</p>

<p>
<br />
</p>

<h3 id="SEMITONE"><b>SEMITONE</b> &#150; the 12<sup><small>
th</small></sup> part of an octave
</h3>

<p>
Western music divides up the octave into 12 more or less equal 
divisions, called semitones.  Because of variants in temperament 
(tuning method), the actual size of semitone divisions can vary.  
Semitones are themselves divided into 100 cents.  All specification 
of semitones in the CDP software may be fractional.  Two decimal places 
equates with <i>cents</i>, the division of a semitone into 100 parts: 
0.01 to 0.99.  A whole tone comprises two semitones.  Thus 1.50 means 
1 semitone &#43; &#189; semitone, i.e., &#190; of a whole tone.  Microtones 
of great precision are therefore catered for in the CDP software.  
This is also true of the (CDP) <i>Spectral Transformer</i> plug-in for 
<b>Project 5</b>.
</p>

<h3 id="SMOOTH"><b>SMOOTH</b> &#150; to level out variations in 
pitch or other data
</h3>

<p>
'Smooth; is a simple word, but enormously relevant in this context.  
It can refer to soft tones, harmonious spectrum, gentle onsets and 
decays, and relaxed, lilting rhythms.  It can also refer to the 
ways in which a sound can be blurred or dissolved, using functions 
such as BLUR BLUR, FOCUS ACCUMULATE, the FILTERS, HILITE TRACE and 
HILITE BLUR-TRACE.  The computer sound manipulation tools therefore 
make it possible to affect the smoothness of a sound in many 
different ways.  This affects emotional tone and the recognisability 
of the sound.
</p>

<p>
<br />
</p>

<h3 id="TEMPO"><b>TEMPO</b> &#150; rate of beat flow per second
</h3>

<p>
Tempo is the number of beats per minute, the pulse.  It is usually as 
expressed as a note-value (e.g., a crotchet&#47;quarter note) = the 
number of times per minute it occurs.  MM stands for Metronome Mark. 
<font face="marl" size="-1"> &#101; </font> = 60. In this case, a crotchet 
occurs 60 times each minute: each beat lasts 1 second.  The general 
formula for the <b>duration of each beat at a given tempo</b> is:<br />
<pre>
<u>&nbsp;Number of seconds in a minute</u>
Number of beats per minute (tempo)
</pre>
The inverse of this is the <b>number of beats per second:</b><br />
<pre>
<u>Number of beats per minute (tempo)</u>
 Number of seconds in a minute
 </pre>
Thus 60 sec. &divide; 60 beats = each beat lasts 1 second.  When the 
tempo is doubled, <font face="marl" size="-1"> &#101; </font> = 120, so 
60 sec. &divide; 120 beats = each beat lasts &#189; sec. and 120 beats 
&divide; 60 sec. = 2 beats per second.  For MM <font face="marl" size="-1"> 
&#101; </font> = 84, 60 sec. &divide; 84 = each beat lasts for 0.714 
sec. and there are 84 &divide; 60 = 1.4 beats per second.  There is 
a more detailed discussion of tempo in <a href="timechart.htm"><b>Time 
Chart</b></a>.
</p>

<p>
Tempo is directly related to human biological activity: the heart-rate 
increases when there is more activity in order to increase the blood 
flow to the muscles.  Thus tempo is a component in expressing action 
or relaxation, excitement or peacefulness, and fear or feeling 
comfortable.  Which tempo to use, as well as changes in tempo, 
immediate or gradual, are therefore musically important features.
</p>

<p>
In sound transformation software, the concept of tempo is further 
extended by including the rate of movement of features internal to 
the sound.  The <i>glissando</i> parameter in FOCUS ACCUMULATE controls 
the rate of internal pitch bend.
</p>

<p>
Another aspect of tempo relevant to sound composition is the rate 
of information flow.  More information in less time increases the 
sense of movement and compresses the sense of time passing.

<h3 id="TEXTURE"><b>TEXTURE</b> &#150; roughen the surface flow 
or create a multi-event assembly in horizontal and vertical space
</h3>

<p>
'Texture' is a very generic term in that it can relate to so many 
things.
</p>

<p>
Sonically, it relates to the smoothness of a sound's flow, just like 
the surface of a painting, which can be almost completely flat, like a 
watercolour, or have increasingly rough surfaces: applied with a palette 
knife or a collage of disparate materials.  <a href="#GRANULATE">
<b>Granulation</b></a> is perhaps the primary technique for texturing 
a sonic surface.
</p>

<p>
Texture also relates to the layering of sonic events, such as homophony 
(melody + chords), counterpoint (simultaneous independent melodic lines), 
and heterophony (intertwining variants of the same melody).  Similarly, 
short motifs can repeat and vary in musical forms such as fugue bridge 
passages, sonata development sections, and the motivic repetitions that 
result from (atonal) 'series' built from repeating figures.
</p>

<p>
This brings us to textures in sound composition, where the same sound 
or similar variants of it are repeated in various densities and overlappings 
in horizontal and vertical space.  Specialised software such as Trevor 
Wishart's TEXTURE Set facilitates the creation of such textures, with 
additional features such as <a href="#RANDOM"><b>randomisation</b></a>, 
mapping to harmonies, using specified rhythms and motifs, and building 
textures on defined linear subsubstructures.
</p>

<h3 id="TIMECONTOUR"><b>VARY OVER TIME</b> &#150; values vary 
with time &#150; automation
</h3>

<p>
As a time-based art, music is intensely concerned with how all its 
component ingredients change over time.  These patterns of change, 
these time contours, create a sonorous symbol which is perceived both 
by the mind and the body as the experience of music.  Without 
time-varying sonic events, nothing is happening, from a musical point 
of view.
</p>

<p>
However, it should also be remembered that temporal changes, as with 
gestures, need to be in step with the overall musical form and intention.  
It is easy to create helter skelter wild textures with computer tools.  
While this is sometimes fun and appropriate, the other end of the spectrum 
should be explored: where the changes over time are slow, easily perceived, 
and tied in with the overall form and gestural nature of the music.
</p>

<p>
In the electronic domain, therefore, it is essential that the component 
parameters for a sound vary over time one way or another and that these 
changes are consonant with the overall form and intent of the music &#150; 
unless a contrast of outer form and inner pattern is deliberately intended.
</p>

<p>
The majority of parameters in the CDP software vary over time.  The changing 
<i>times</i> and <i>values</i> are specified in a 
<a href="filestxt.htm#BREAKPOINTFILES"><b>breakpoint file</b></a>.  Our 
first venture in real-time automation was with the <i>Spectral Transformer</i> 
plug-in for Calewalk's <b>Project 5</b>, where there are low frequency 
oscillators (LFOs) and ultra low frequency oscillators (ULFOs) as well 
as the parameters themselves.
