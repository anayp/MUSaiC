Summary of TV MIDI input procedures in Soundloom:  TableEditor and Calculator.

Selection of MIDI input device is handled via System Settings 2.
The all-important control note (to terminate recording) is set here. This choice
is used to write a private script "tvscript.tv", which is deleted when Soundloom is closed.
The suggestion is that this would typically be the lowest note on the input keyboard, 
but in principle it can be any MIDI note.

An example of the script is included here. 
(In Soundloom source code, the code to generate the script is in _newdisplay.tcl).

On selecting e.g. TableEditor and clicking the little keyboard icon, 
first a small dialog box is put up where MIDI Note options are set.
On clicking "Get Midi" a new dialog box is shown saying "Waiting".
OK has to be clicked in order for recording to start. 
At this point literally the only way to get back to the main window is by pressing 
the required trigger note on the keyboard. This ensures that the tv script exits,
returning control to Soundloom.

The recording is stored in the text file "tvout" inside _cdpenv. 
The data is also copied to e.g. the INPUT table in Table Editor, suitably modified
to show a note list possibly with durations.
