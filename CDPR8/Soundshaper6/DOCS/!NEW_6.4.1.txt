SOUNDSHAPER WHAT'S NEW VERSION 6.4.1 (June '25)
====================================

New in 6.4.1:
-------------
This version fixes some bugs found in 6.4 (now withdrawn).
• Updated the handling of options for loading patches - see DOCS\Patch_Save+Load.pdf
  Summary: check "Include Sources" to auto-run the patch as saved; uncheck it to run it with different source(s); 
           check PatchPreview to see the patch before running it or choosing different source(s).  
• Preview: Balance option was not working - corrected
• From 6.3.1: some changes to how files are copied and erased, to accommodate WINE.
• BUGFIXES:
  In Graph-Editor, the sound player was not always closing, and the soundfile concerned couldn't be closed withut quitting Soundshaper
  Process Grid for Data menu was not displaying. 


New in 6.3:
-----------
• Process part of a sound without having to do this 'manually' by cutting and pasting.
• Overwrite part of a file with silence
• Balance Option: balance output level to match level of input sound
  For details see separate file: DOCS\NEW_FEATURES_6.3.pdf

New in 6.2:
-----------
• CDP Release 8: full software release. The program exes are installed into the _cdprogs sub-folder.
• Release 8 functions are fully integrated into Soundshaper Menus. A few new programs are undocumented or currently unsupported.
• Texture Simple has been upgraded to the Rel8 version. The tutorial presets have also been upgraded.
  (For now, the bat/bash scripts in the CDP documentation have NOT been updated, but only require one further parameter (with value 0).
  Details are given in the documentation.)
• Process Grids (an alternative way of selecting a process) have been upgraded for Rel.8. 
• Various minor bugfixes and improvements. 

New in 6.1:
-----------
• CDP8 pre-release Beta software. The new programs are included in the _cdprogs folder.
  This is a huge upgrade and all new .exes are subject to possible revision. 

• Soundshaper support for most of CDP8. The new programs are listed in the menu Rel8, as well as being integrated into the main program menus (Soundfile, Spectral etc.)
  The separate Rel8 menu allows you to identify and explore the new software. Feedback would be very welcome!

• The revised QuickHelp on the Parameter Page (F1) includes descriptions and param. ranges for each CDP8 program. 
  The QuickHelp on the Main Page (also F1) has brief descriptions.
  The official documentation for CDP8 is in progress and will be posted online soon. 

• New datafiles for CDP8 processes (and some revisions of older ones).

• Various bugfixes and tidy-ups (probably not worth listing). 

New in 6.03:
------------
• INSTALLATION NOW INCLUDES CDP Software.
  New compilation of CDP also available for upgraders.

• Processes using fixed parameter values can now be re-edited. 
  Affects: Speccut, Grab, Cut, ZCut, Excise, Insert, Replace and all fixed Level processes (such as Gain +3dB).
  (Previously, a message stated that there was no parameter file to re-run the process. Now there is.)

• Multichan to Stereo (new in Channels menu): Extracts all channels from a multichannel file and uses Mix Page to remix these to stereo. This is especially designed for creating chords: 
  1) Use MtoN to create a multi-channel version of the source for the desired number of notes in the chord (max. 12)
  2) On Param. page for spectral TRANSPOSE (preserving time) 
     - choose Process Transpose
     - check Multi-Params (top right): this enables different values for each channel
     - for each channel (i.e. pitch) select a different value for transpose and click Snapshot 1, 2, ...etc. 
     - click Render when finished
  3) On Main page, select Edit/Mix | Channels | Multichan to Stereo --> Mix Page.
  4) On Mix Page, for each channelised sound (e.g. ~A_2_c1.wav) set level and pan; optionally also a delayed start time. (Note that level will normally have to be reduced.) Click MIX to mix to stereo.     

• Param. Page: Time-buttons restored, for processes with START and END parameters. These processes have built-in time-ranges, so do not need Soundshaper's Process At Loops/Markers (or do not support these).
  - Main Page: set Markers, e.g. by clicking GET LOOPS button to catch Loop points.
  - Param. Page: Markers should normally be transferred to the page. (Loop points are not). 
    For START (or equivalent) clicking the T button copies the Left marker time to the param. value.
    For END (if relevant) clicking the T button copies the Right marker time to the param. value.
Note that when markers are transferred to the Param. Page, the first marker shown is always 0; your Start time is probably the next marker - click the right arrow button to select your transferred pair. 
       

New in 6.02 (Nov. '22:
------------
• ENVELOPE CREATE and CREATEB (breakpoint)
  Fixed bugs and revised both
• ENVEDIT (edit breakpoint envelope file) - revised. 
  Edits existing envelope in Graph-Edit, but without soundfile display
• ENVDRAW (new): auto-extracts breakpoint envelope from soundfile; edit in Graph-Edit with soundfile display
  (NB: follow the messages carefully, as the edits have to be made in Graph-Edit. Do NOT click SAVE CHANGES!)
• Restyled ENVELOPE Menu

• New revised QuickHelp on Main Page (F1):
  If F1 selected, scrolling through menus displays brief description and IN/OUT requirements
  Select process as normal.

• SAVE PANEL: spectral output can now save to .wav
  If already auto-converted, .wav extension is displayed - save to .wav
  If not converted (Option 5 Auto-FFT - OFF), selecting .wav extension autoconverts and saves to .wav.

• Bugfixes: 
  - PSINTERLEAVE and PSREPLACE fixed for stereo Infile 1, but Infile 2 must still be MONO for now.
  - RMSINFO was missing an option (-n flag)
  - SpecBare was crashing with CDP Error
