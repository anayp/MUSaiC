Pool.lst stores the full path of a (sound)file and displays the list on the Main page in a drop-down box, so that some sound sources are easily available.

Pool.lst initially contains a list of sounds WITHOUT a full path. In this case, Soundshaper prefixes your TEMP.OUTFILES folder, as defined in SETTINGS, to complete the path.  (If a file with this path+name does not exist, it is not displayed.)

If the files are not displayed for any reason, you can always load these sounds individually and add them to the list.

The list can also be edited manually, e.g. to remove unwanted items.
