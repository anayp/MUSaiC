The file Processes.txt lists favourite CDP processes, and is displayed on the Main page as a drop down box, for easy access to these processes.

The processes are named using Soundshaper Shortnames, which are given in the file Shortnames.txt in the Soundshaper\BAT subfolder. (This file should NOT be altered or Soundshaper will not work properly.)

Once you have run a process, you can add its name to the list, from within Soundshaper. 

Processes.txt can also be edited manually. If you know the process name -- it's also displayed on the Parameter Page -- you could add it as text to the list. Or you can delete unwanted items from the list.
