TUTORIAL PATCHES
================

Patches.txt stores the full path of a Soundshaper patch file (.ssp), and displays the list on the Main page in a drop-down box (click PATCHES button), so that patches can be run easily.

Patches.txt initially contains a list of tutorial patches WITHOUT a full path. In this case, Soundshaper prefixes your Patches-folder, as defined in SETTINGS, to complete the path.  (If a file with this path+name does not exist, it is not displayed.)

To display and run the tutorial patches, which is downloadable separately, unzip the package to your base CDP-folder. The files will unzip to this default folder: <CDP-folder>\TXT\PATCHES\TUTORIAL\  .
 
If your User-folder is not the default <CDP-folder>\TXT, and/or your patches folder is not 
<User-folder>\PATCHES then you will need to move the tutorial folder to your patches folder (so that it is in <Patches-folder>\TUTORIAL , or <User-folder>\PATCHES\TUTORIAL ,which may be the same thing).


If the list is still not displayed, you can always load these patches individually and add them to the list.  

The list can also be edited manually, e.g. to remove unwanted items.
