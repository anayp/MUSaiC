==========

The textfile Favorites.txt gives the full path of external programs you might want to run from Soundshaper. You can add programs to this list from within Soundshaper:
	Menu: File > FAVORITES > Select Favorite program  [or Ctrl+Alt+F10]

In case you want to edit the list manually, it is structured in paired lines of:
	Menu Text Description		[ e.g. Audacity ]
	Program path			[ e.g. C:\Program Files\Audacity 1.3\audacity.exe ]
