TEXTPACK
--------
Textpack.dat contains the full collection of Textpack examples by Archer Endrich of CDP.

This is a 'global' preset file: i.e. it should be selected on Soundshaper's Main page, and the option "Use Global Presets" should also be set. When you visit the Parameter page for any of the Texture processes, the relevant presets should be there, ready to run.

SINGLES
-------
Note that the same examples have also been supplied as single .dat files, one for each of the Texture processes. These are located in the individual Process folders, e.g. Simple.dat is found in the subfolder \Simple.  These presets are available 'locally': either no global presetfile should be selected, or the option "Use Global Presets" should be unchecked.

Note on the file structure
---------------------------
This is rather an old preset file and should not be regarded as a 'model' on how to set up such a collection.  Normally the .dat file would be within the \textpack folder. Datafiles are stored with an incomplete path to which Soundshaper prefixes the path of the .dat file. 

Here each datafile begins with 'textpack', so it is necessary to put the .dat file outside the \textpack folder, so that the correct prefix is applied.
